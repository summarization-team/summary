In January 2005 in Los Angeles, Juan Alvarez drove his SUV onto Metrolink train tracks, poured gasoline on himself and the car, then scrambled out of the SUV as the train was coming, leaving the SUV behind.
The train hit the SUV, killing or injuring 191 passengers.
Alvarez was indicted for murder.
At trial, Alvarez, an admitted methamphetamine user, maintained that he was trying to kill himself and never meant to harm anyone else.
The prosecution maintained that Alvarez caused the train wreck to attract his estranged wife's attention.
He was convicted.
Prosecutors asked for the death penalty.

Rat poison (Aminopterina rodenticide) has been found in the Menu Food’s pet food that was recalled.
It is unknown how the rat poison got into the pet food.
At least 16 animal deaths (15 cats and one dog) have died from the recalled pet food.
The FDA is investigating the recall and the Canadian factory where the pet was produced is temporarily shut down.
Several law suits, including a class action suit have been filed by pet owners whose pets died.
The FDA’s investigation is focused on wheat gluten for the source of the poison.

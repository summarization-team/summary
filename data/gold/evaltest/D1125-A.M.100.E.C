NASA has reported the loss from global warming of 30 percent of the Arctic Ocean's sea ice.
This has led to a steadily decline in the polar bear population.
Polar bears depend on ice for travel and hunting for food.
Recently the Interior Secretary agreed under pressure from environmental groups to propose designating polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
The designation prohibits federal agencies from authorizing anything, including oil drilling, that would harm the bears' habitat.
The administration has prohibited its scientists, when acting as government representatives, from linking human factors to polar bears and global warming.

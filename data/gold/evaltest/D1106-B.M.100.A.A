Five international tuna conservation bodies, known as Regional Fisheries Management Organizations adopted a joint action plan, pledging to strengthen efforts to combat tuna overfishing and ensure sustainable use of tuna.
About 300 representatives from over 60 countries attended the five day meeting in Japan.
A follow-up meeting was scheduled for early 2008 in the USA.
Also recently the European Union and Japan agreed to slash their tuna quotas by more than 20%.
But negotiations faced difficulty since they are hard to enforce and tuna fishing is very lucrative particularly for developing countries.

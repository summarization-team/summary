A crane-carrying vessel slammed into an oil-tanker off South Korea's west coast Friday, causing the tanker to leak about 66,000 barrels of crude oil, officials said.
It was the largest spill in Korean waters.
There were no human casualties.
The leakage was stopped by late afternoon, and workers concentrated on cleaning up the spill.
Strong winds and prevailing currents meant oil would probably start washing on shore as early as Saturday.
Korea's coast guard sent dozens of ships to prevent the oil from reaching the shoreline.
The ecologically sensitive region is popular for its beaches and as a bird sanctuary.

Trial of 29, mostly Moroccan suspects, for the 2004 Madrid train bombings, where 191 people were killed, 1824 injured, begins in the suburbs of Madrid, Spain.
The trial is expected to last 6 months and have more than 600 witnesses and 107 experts testify.
Spain raised its terrorism alert to the medium level.
Six of the suspects are considered the chief plotters behind the bombing.
The suspects are attributed to the Moroccan Islamic Combat Group, a North African al-Qaeda offshoot.
Seven other major suspects blew themselves up in Madrid in April 2004 when Spanish police closed in on them.

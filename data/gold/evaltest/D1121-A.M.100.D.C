NFL star Michael Vick pleaded not guilty to federal dog fighting charges and was released without bond until his trial date.
Three co-defendants were indicted also.
The dogs were reported killed in fighting, shot, hanged, or drowned.
The allegations detailed in an indictment sparked protests and awareness campaigns by animal rights groups.
On April 25 investigators conducting a drug search at Vick's home found 66 dogs and dog fighting equipment.
One defendant pleaded guilty and will cooperate with the prosecution.
The NFL has told Vick to stay away from training camp.
Vick has lost his endorsements with several prominent companies.

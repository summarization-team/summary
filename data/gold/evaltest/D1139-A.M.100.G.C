In mid-November 2008, pirates seized control of the Saudi-owned super oil tanker Sirius Star off the east coast of Africa for ransom and took it to Somalia.
The raid avoided international warship patrols in the general area.
The vessel is the largest ship hijacked by Somali pirates.
It's not clear whether armed security was on board.
All 25 crew members are reported to be safe.
The tanker carried 2 million barrels of oil worth $100 million.
The hijacking highlighted the vulnerability of large ships.
It also demonstrated the bandits' heightened ambitions and capabilities.
Piracy is the biggest economy in Somalia.

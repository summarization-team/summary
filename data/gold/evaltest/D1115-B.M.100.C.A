A huge clean-up operation on South Korea’s southwest coast took place after the country’s largest oil spill.
It is estimated the clean-up will take two months.
A state of emergency has been declared in the region where beaches and farms dependent on the sea have been badly affected.
There is serious damage along 17 to 20 kilometers of the coastline.
Booms are being set-up to protect the fishing farms.
Approximately 6,000 people, volunteers, coast guard, military and government are helping with the clean-up.
No official estimate of the damage is yet available.

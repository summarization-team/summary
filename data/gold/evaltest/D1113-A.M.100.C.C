Four years ago, a ship seized in Singapore carried over 6 tons of elephant ivory, the largest shipment of the contraband material since its international trade was banned in 1989.
DNA identified the source of the ivory as Zambia.
Since then, ivory smuggling has increased.
Police seized the largest amount of ivory ever in Japan.
CITES, the UN agency regulating this trade, urged African countries to overcome their divide over the ban.
Positions range from requests to downgrade controls to maintaining a complete ban for 20 years.
Proper elephant management can keep elephant populations stable and enable some ivory trading.

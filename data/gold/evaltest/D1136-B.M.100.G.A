Nearly 10 million people across southern and southwestern China are suffering from drinking water shortages due to a fierce drought.
Farming and livestock have also been severely affected.
Water works projects with diverting water from areas with more water, digging deep wells, trucking in water, and artificial rainfall attempts are being used to help the water shortage.
More than 400 Chinese cities suffered water shortages, 110 with serious problems.
Caps on water consumption and increased fees are also being used to control the shortages.

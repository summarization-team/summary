Two days after the May 13 terror bombings in Jaipur, Indian officials revised the casualty figures to 61 killed and 90 injured.
A daylong curfew was in effect in Jaipur, and foreign tourists were restricted to their hotels.
Rapid Action Force personnel and state police were patrolling the streets to head off any potential Hindu-Muslim violence.
A previously unknown group calling itself the Indian Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for the blasts.
Police distributed a sketch of a man they were seeking for questioning.
Portugal, Japan, Afghanistan, and China condemned the bombings, as did U.N Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.

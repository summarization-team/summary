Madrid train bombing suspect, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmen, the first of the suspects to testify, is considered to be one of four masterminds of the bombing.
There are recorded phone conversations of him admitting to his guilt and being prepared to die for his cause.
He denied any guilt during his testimony.
The second accused, Youssef Belhadj said he would only respond through his lawyer.
Prosecutors are asking for prison sentence of 38,656 years but Spanish law only allows no more than 40 years.

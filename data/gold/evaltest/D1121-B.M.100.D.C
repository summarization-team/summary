The Southern Christian Leadership Conference has withdrawn it decision to honor Michael Vick at its annual conference.
The two remaining co-defendants in the dog fighting trial have pleaded guilty.
If convicted at trial, all four defendants would face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
They are charged with conspiring to travel unlawfully in interstate commerce and sponsoring dogs in fighting ventures.
The other pleas put pressure on Vick to plead guilty to avoid additional charges of gambling and financing the fights.
The NFL prohibits players from gambling.
Vick has not yet decided whether to plead guilty.

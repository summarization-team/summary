Lake Meade, the vast reservoir for the Colorado River water could be run near dry by 2021, according to study by scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
The study said there is a 50% chance of this happening.
Changes in climate and strong demand for water from the fastest growing area in the USA are the causes.
But heavy rains from a very wet winter of 2007 and 2008 have at least temporarily raised lake levels higher than the last 10 to 12 years.

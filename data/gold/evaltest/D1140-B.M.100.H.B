Bangladesh is hammered by monsoon floods every year that kill hundreds, submerge at least one-fifth the country, and destroy numerous homes/crops.
Among this year's displaced citizens, 300,000 have been placed in government shelters.
India's Meteorological Department said monsoon patterns this year have led to heavier than normal rains.
Financial relief has come from Great Britain and Germany.
The Bangladesh military, local groups, and international organizations are distributing relief materials.
Death toll estimates may swell to over 1000.
On August 8th, the count was 120.
Medical teams are providing services because water-borne diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and skin diseases spread quickly.

On Saturday, the oil spill reached the shore.
Hundreds of troops, police and residents used buckets to remove the oil from popular Mallipo beach.
Inadequate equipment hampered their efforts.
The coast guard mobilized 103 ships and six helicopters to help the clean up.
By Saturday evening the affected shoreline had more than doubled.
The government designated the spill a ''disaster'' to make regional government assistance easier.
By Sunday, thousands were helping the clean-up which was said to take months to complete.
In addition to environmental damage, hundreds of sea farms for oyster, abalone, clam and other seafood were affected.

Two Tokyo-based fishing industry groups issued a statement to five international regional tuna conservation bodies calling for limits on the overfishing of tuna which is driving tuna to extinction.
By 2004, the number of adult blue fin tuna capable of spawning had fallen to 19 percent of its 1975 level.
The five regional bodies held a conference in Kobe, Japan to discuss the issue and develop a global plan of action.
The international officials recommended a plan to foster communication and data sharing among the regions, tracking fish from ocean to market, and establishment of a high seas inspection team.

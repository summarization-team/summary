At sentencing, the judge and jury didn't find Alvarez's apology to the families convincing.
Nevertheless the jury sentenced him to prison for life without parole because they believed he didn't intend to kill anyone.
Some relatives of the dead wanted Alvarez executed.
Others considered life in prison justified as worse than execution.
Relatives gave harrowing testimony about the impact of this tragedy on their lives going forward.
Alvarez's family testified that he was mentally ill and had been brutally abused sexually and physically as a child.
Experts opined that his history of abuse saved him from the death penalty.

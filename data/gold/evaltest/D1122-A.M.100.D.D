At least four people are dead, 79 injured and about 30 are missing.
The death toll is expected to change, as divers search for bodies trapped underwater.
Terror attack was ruled out as a cause.
The bridge, which was found to have structural deficiencies in 2005, was undergoing repairs when it collapsed.

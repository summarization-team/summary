Spain raised its terrorism alert level to medium on Tuesday as a precaution ahead of the Thursday trial of 29 suspects in the allegedly Al-Qaeda inspired Madrid train bombings on March 11, 2004.
The bombings killed 191 and injured about 4,000 people.
Most defendants were Moroccan members of Islamic militant groups.
Four defendants were charged as masterminds, seven were charged with membership in a terrorist organization, and the rest were charged with lesser offenses.
The focus of the trial is Ahmed, an Egyptian, who said in recordings that he planned the attack.
If convicted, the masterminds could receive 40-year sentences.

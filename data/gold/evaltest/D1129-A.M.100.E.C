Two new vitamin D studies correlated high levels of vitamin D in the body with possible prevention of breast and colon cancers.
The studies found a possible 50% reduction in breast cancer and 66% in colon cancer in whites.
There are no findings for darker skinned people.
An important source of vitamin D is sunshine which may explain people in warmer climates have more of it and a lower incidence of these cancers than people in more northern areas.
Vitamin D is also available through supplements and certain foods.
Experts differ on how much people should take in artificial substitutes.

A US Food and Drug Administration review of the safety and effectiveness of cough and cold medicines for children under two suggested that all of these ''infant'' drugs should be removed from the market, and measurement devices should be standardized to reduce risks of overdosing.
The agency also looked at the effects of combined dosing.
These medicines could lead to arrhythmias, hypertension or strokes.
There are over 800 over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold products.
Major drug manufacturers like Johnson and Johnson and Wyeth have announced voluntary withdrawals of products for children under two for fear they would be misused.

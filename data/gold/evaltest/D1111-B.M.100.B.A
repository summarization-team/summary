The teenager who killed 8 people in the Finland high school was considered a social outcast, was bullied in school but it appears he picked his victims randomly, police stated.
The motive for the shootings is unclear but the shooter shouted slogans of ''revolution''.
The shooter had no previous criminal record and he was from an ordinary family.
There have been other threats on the internet in Finland closing schools but it appears these have been pranks and not real.
Finland is considering changing the age for gun ownership from 16 to 18.
Classes resumed at the school on Thursday.

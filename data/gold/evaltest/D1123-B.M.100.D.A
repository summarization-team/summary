The U.S. embassy in Athens reopened Tuesday, four days after a rocket attack that stunned the country, but no arrests have yet been made.
Officials are studying footage from the embassy’s security cameras, Greek local cameras and cell phone communications near the area of the attack.
FBI experts have joined the investigation.
It is now known that it was a Chinese designed weapon used in the attack.
There is also an investigation into the security around the embassy since it is one of the most highly guarded buildings in Athens.

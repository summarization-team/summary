Indonesia widened the search for survivors of the December 29 disaster after 13 were rescued Wednesday clinging to an oil rig 350 kilometers away.
245 people including the captain were rescued out of 628 on board.
23 bodies were recovered.
The exact location of the wreck is unknown.
Sunday, a cargo ship picked up 14 survivors on a lifeboat 600 km away.
Many lifeboats were equipped with emergency rations and water.
Waves likely washed in over the car deck door and became trapped, adding weight and causing instability.
Similar accidents on other RO-RO ferries prompt calls for a design change.

Sea turtles face a host of threats around the world.
They are caught in fishing nets and lines, pollution makes them sick and kills them, some are killed for meat and their shells.
There are some efforts around the world to help the turtles, an effort to have a hatching area on the Pacific coast of Mexico, arrest of poachers in Malaysia, education by various conservation organizations, captive raising of rare type of turtles in zoos.
A sea turtle in China can sell for a $1000.00, eggs bring a high price, making saving them very difficult.

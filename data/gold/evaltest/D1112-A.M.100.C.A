Juan Manuel Alvarez, 29 year old, was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without parole by a Los Angeles jury, for murder of 11 people and injuring 180 others.
On January 26, 2005, he parked his SUV, soaked in gasoline, on a train track, where it was hit by a commuter train, which then ran into two other trains.
Mr. Alvarez pled not guilty, saying he was only trying to kill himself.
LA prosecutors were seeking the death penalty.

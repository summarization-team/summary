Approximately 250 survivors and 23 bodies have been found by search and rescue efforts as of January 11, 2007.
The exact location of the sinking of the ferry is not known.
Navy has done some searching for the ferry with radar and divers but bad weather and poor visibility halted their efforts.
The captain of the ferry was rescued but he remains in the hospital.
Strong winds and the sea currents have carried the survivors for 100s of miles, therefore the search had to be widened.
Some 400 people are still missing.

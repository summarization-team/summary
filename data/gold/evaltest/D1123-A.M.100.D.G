The rocket strike against the US embassy in Athens on Friday, January 12, 2007, seemed a symbolic gesture by domestic terrorists.
A rocket-propelled grenade (RPG7) fired from a nearby construction site at 5:58am struck the third floor above the front entrance, damaged a bathroom, and shattered glass in nearby buildings.
There were no casualties.
Greek authorities cooperated fully.
Police searched the area for evidence and examined surveillance videos.
A task force led by a former counterterrorism chief would investigate the attack.
U.S. FBI forensic experts were coming to help with the probe.
The extreme left-wing group Revolutionary Struggle claimed responsibility.

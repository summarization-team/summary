Church bells tolled across Amish country in memory of five girls who were kidnapped and killed in their schoolhouse.
Roberts, the gunman, called his wife from the school to tell her the reasons for his actions.
His motives remain unclear.
Police attempts to talk Roberts into releasing the hostages were unsuccessful.
Members of the Amish community have forgiven Roberts.
The school was demolished in a move to help the Amish community to move on.
Several months later, a new school is being built near the old one.
The injured girls have recovered except for one who remains in a coma.

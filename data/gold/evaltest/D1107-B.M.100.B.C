China said it was willing to work with the world community on improving food safety as it responded to global concerns about the safety of Chinese food exports.
An official said that China has set up a complete monitoring system to ensure safety of food exports.
China had been heavily criticized for exporting contaminated food to the US and Japan.
As part of its safety campaign, China has admitted to rampant fraud in its food industry which it plans to correct.
Its focus will be on small food producers and on better coordination of multiple organizations responsible inspecting food exports.

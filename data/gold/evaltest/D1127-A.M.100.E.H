Recent studies have linked insufficient sleep to a variety of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.
In addition to its physiological manifestations, lack of sleep can negatively affect one’s emotional state, mental abilities, performance, and productivity.
A British study found that sleep deprivation seems to negatively impact women’s health more than men’s.
Many persons, particularly the elderly, suffer from sleep disorders, but not all doctors are adequately trained to recognize or treat such conditions.
Experts recommend that adults should get seven to nine hours of sleep each night to function at their highest level.

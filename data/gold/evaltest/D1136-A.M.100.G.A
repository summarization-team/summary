China faces water shortages because of rising temperatures (global warming), increased use by growing population, pollution of water from rapidly growing industry, and need for dams for electrical power.
Drought from reduced rainfall and rising average temperatures has significantly reduced China’s grain production so that China will have to continue to import grain to feed its growing population.
China’s rivers have been impacted, the Yangtze is at its lowest level in over 100 years.
Fish and wildlife have also been adversely impacted.
Building sea desalination plants, conservation, reducing green house gases, are how China is trying to combat water shortages.

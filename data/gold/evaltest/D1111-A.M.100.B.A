A teenager at a school in Finland went on a shooting rampage Wednesday, November 11, 2007, killing 8 people, then himself.
The shooter, Pekka-Eric Auvinen, an 18 year old student at the Jokela High school in southern Finland, shot and killed 3 women, including the headmaster, a nurse, and five boys, ages between 16 and 18.
Shootings like this are very rare in Finland and this is the worst in the country’s history.
It is not clear why this happened, but he posted a video on YouTube about being a ''natural selector''.

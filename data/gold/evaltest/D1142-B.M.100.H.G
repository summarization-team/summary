Anti-riot troops and police enforced a two-day curfew to prevent retaliatory violence.
Casualty numbers were revised to 61 dead and 90 injured.
The bombs were in bags strapped to bicycles at intersections and markets centering around Johri Bazaar.
Police released a sketch of a man in his early 20s who bought the bicycles at two local shops.
The previously unknown Indian Mujahedeen claimed responsibility in two videos showing a bomb-strapped bicycle parked in the market, and an email that said Jaipur was targeted to disrupt tourism.
It demanded India stop working with the US and Britain.
Pakistan denied any role.

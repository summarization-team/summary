For the first time, the five global bodies regulating tuna fishing approved in principle a plan to save tuna from overfishing, including measures to monitor the animals' populations across regions and ensure sustainable use of resources.
The nonbinding action plan does not include specific catch quotas for each member.
Conflicts among participants included Japan's request to limit fishing of smaller tuna which Europe resisted to protect its canned tuna industry.
Monitoring regulatory bodies, excess capacity, and poaching also created unresolved issues.
Environmentalists criticized the inadequate environmental controls.
In a related ICCAT agreement, several countries have voluntarily slashed their tuna quotas.

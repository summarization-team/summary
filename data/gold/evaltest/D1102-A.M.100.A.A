Internet security has become a critical issue recently with the growing sophistication of hackers, the vastness of internet, and the world wide dependence on the internet.
Attacks by systems called botnets use millions of internet computers to create spam to slow down the internet or gather personal information.
Also the internet root servers were attacked in a denial of service attempt.
Companies like VeriSign and Microsoft are spending billions to strengthen the internet internal structure and provide better security software.
Private and government groups are working together to possibly redesign the internet from the ground up.

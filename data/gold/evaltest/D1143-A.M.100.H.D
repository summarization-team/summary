OJ Simpson and five co-defendants were arrested, accused of storming a Las Vegas hotel room and stealing at gunpoint sports memorabilia valued around $100,000.
Simpson faces 11 charges, including felony charges of kidnapping, assault with a weapon, armed robbery, burglary, conspiracy, and coercion.
The kidnapping charge carries a possible life sentence.
Police seized evidence, including two firearms, at a private residence Sunday.
Simpson was released on $125,000 bail without entering a plea.
One co-defendant agreed to plead guilty to reduced charges and testify against the others.
Simpson is due in Las Vegas District Court for a preliminary hearing in November.

SW China is experiencing a severe water shortage due to reduced rainfall, strains of economic and population growth, and disappearing glaciers and faster evaporation caused by global warming.
The Yangtze River, which provides water for navigation, factories, hydroelectric plants, agriculture, fish stocks, and humans, hit a record low.
Countermeasures include releasing dam water; digging out sludge, exploding reefs, and banning large vessels to improve navigation in shrinking waterways; increasing sea water desalination; water wagons for humans and cattle; building weirs to preserve water and provide food for migratory birds; establishing consumption quotas; and reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

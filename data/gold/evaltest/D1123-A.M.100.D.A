An anti-tank shell was fired at the U.S. embassy in Athens, Greece, early Friday morning, January 12, 2007, striking the front of the building but causing no injuries, and only minor damage to the building.
Greek officials said the attack was apparently aimed at the embassy’s emblem and was a ''symbolic'' gesture.
Two domestic groups claimed responsibility for the attack.
Greek officials said police would set up a task force, headed by a former counterterrorism chief to investigate the attack.

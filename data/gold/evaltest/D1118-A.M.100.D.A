Eight people were killed, five others injured in Omaha, Nebraska when Robert Hawkins, age 19, went on a shooting spree in a shopping mall.
The shooting only lasted a few minutes, then Hawkins shot and killed himself.
There was no clear motive for shooting and victims were picked at random.
Hawkins had recently broke up with his girlfriend, had been fired from his job at McDonalds.
His friends and family said he seemed depressed.
He left what seemed like a suicide note which said he was ''sorry for everything'' and ''now I’ll be famous.''

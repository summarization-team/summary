An 8-lane bridge across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis suddenly collapsed in rush-hour traffic, killing and injuring an as yet unknown number of people.
The bridge was undergoing repairs at the time.
The governor said the bridge had been inspected and had no major problems.
However, a report to to the federal government designated the bridge as structurally deficient.
At least 50 cars fell into the water.
Divers were looking for survivors and bodies.
The President promised financial assistance in rebuilding the bridge.
The first step of a federal investigation will be to recover and reassemble pieces of the bridge.

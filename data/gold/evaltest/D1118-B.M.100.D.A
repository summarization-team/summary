Robert Hawkins appeared to have a troubled past.
A portrait of his past showed a disturbed youth who had been a ward of the state and spent time in substance abuse and mental health counseling after he displayed homicidal tendencies towards his stepmother.
Police confirmed there was no link between him and his victims.
The AK-47 he used in the attacked was apparently stolen from his stepfather.

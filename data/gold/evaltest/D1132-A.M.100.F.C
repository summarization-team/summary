Most of the seven types of sea turtles worldwide are endangered, mostly because of poaching but also because of pollution, fishing, habitat loss, and cold waters.
Turtles are poached for their shells, medicinal properties, and meat.
39 Chinese nationals found with 318 protected turtles, most of them dead, were recently arrested in Malaysian waters.
Most were sentenced to prison.
Despite the sentences, poaching is expected to continue because it is lucrative.
Voluntary protection groups as described in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, government and scientific programs, and raising turtles in captivity as at the Atlanta zoo, are efforts to save the turtles.

Sixty countries participated in the first tuna summit, aimed at reversing the decline of this valuable and endangered fish whose annual catch is worth hundreds of millions and which keeps the ocean ecosystem in balance.
Atlantic bluefin tuna are 19 percent of their 1975 level.
Indian Ocean bluefin are down 90 percent.
Tuna’s popularity in Japanese cuisine is a factor.
Attendees agreed to ocean-to-market fish tracking.
They discussed stricter restrictions on purse seining, sharing information on poachers, and a high seas inspection team.
Tuna farms are another option.
Earlier, Mediterranean bluefin quotas were reduced and Japan halved its Pacific quota.

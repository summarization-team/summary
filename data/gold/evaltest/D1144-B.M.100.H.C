Reports indicate that the fallout from the purchase of Chinese lead-painted toys and parts continues.
Mattel, the largest toy company, has suffered decline in reputation and revenue from recall of 18,000,000 toys.
Consumers are refusing to purchase Chinese-made toys for fear the toys will harm their children.
The recalls are happening just as retailers prepare for the holiday season.
Countermeasures include retailers promoting more American- or European-made toys.
Some manufacturers are replacing lead-painted parts with safe substitutes.
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission is questioning whether the Fisher Price toy company reported its lead paint problem as required by law.

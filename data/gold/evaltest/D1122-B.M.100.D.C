Minnesota officials were warned in 1990 that the collapsed freeway bridge was structurally deficient and warned again in a 2005 federal government report.
The official death toll is at five, not counting those who fell in the river in their cars and drowned.
Around 100 were injured.
30 are counted as missing.
The lowered level and speed of the river aided the search for survivors and bodies until the weather got bad.
Only the north half of the bridge collapsed, causing most of the damage.
Authorities don't know the cause of the collapse, but believe this may offer a clue.

Five young Amish girls were killed, shot by a lone gunman.
At about 1045, on October 02, 2006, the gunman, Charles Carl Roberts IV, age 32, entered the Georgetown Amish School in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, a tiny village about 55 miles west of Philadelphia.
He let the boys and the adults go, before he tied up the girls, ages 6 to 13.
Police and emergency personnel rushed to the school but the gunman killed himself as they arrived.
His motive was unclear but in a cell call to his wife he talked about abusing two family members 20 years ago.

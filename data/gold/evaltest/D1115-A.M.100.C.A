A Hong Kong registered oil tanker leaked 10,810 tons, or 66,000 barrels of crude oil off South Korea’s west coast on Friday, December 12, 2007, in what is estimated to be the nation’s largest maritime oil spill.
The spill occurred when a barge carrying a crane crashed into the tanker.
The government sent 57 vessels and 4 helicopters to try to contain the oil spill.
There were no human casualties.
Oil had reached South Korea’s western coast by Saturday but no estimate of damage to the environmentally sensitive area was know yet.

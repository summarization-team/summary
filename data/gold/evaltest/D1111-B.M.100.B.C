Auvinen, the shooter, was a social outcast who was bullied in school, but appeared to shoot his victims randomly.
He left a suicide note saying good-bye to his family and ''indicating his will against society''.
The government declared a day of mourning for his victims.
The shooting brought out copycat threats at other schools and increased security.
Auvinen purchased the gun legally.
Parliament is now considering raising the age of gun ownership from 15 to 18.
This would not have stopped Avinen, who was 18.
Finland has the third highest per capita gun ownership behind the US and Yemen.

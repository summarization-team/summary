A ferry sank en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang on Friday, December 29, 2006, carrying 542 passengers and 57 crew.
At least 218 people have been rescued by Monday night.
Bad weather is believed to be the cause of the sinking.
Survivors said the ferry took on water in the heavy seas and sank in 10 minutes.
The bad weather has made the rescue attempts very difficult, with food and water being dropped to people in life boats.
Warships, fishing vessels, and helicopters have fought the bad weather and very rough seas.

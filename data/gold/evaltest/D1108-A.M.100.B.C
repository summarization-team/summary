A fierce cyclone, Sidr, smashed into Bangladesh's southwestern coast November 2007 wiping out homes and trees.
Officials described it as the worst storm in years.
The wind velocity on the coast was 220 to 240 kilometers.
The area is close to the Indian state of West Bengal which is also experiencing high winds.
The coastal area is home to many poor fishing communities and a vast mangrove forest.
Villagers were urged to seek shelter in the country's cyclone shelters.
The death toll is believed to be in the hundreds.
The United States, Germany, and the WFO are sending aid.

International fishing groups and organizations from industry, government and private environmental groups met in Japan to develop a action plan to deal with critical problem of overfishing of tuna.
Japan has key interest in this issue since Japan consumes approximately one fourth of the worlds tuna catch, more than any other country.
By 2004 the adult bluefin tuna capable of spawning dropped to 19% of its 1975 level in some areas.
The action plan should address ways to share information to monitor tuna numbers, help control illegal fishing vessels, clamp down on poaching and overfishing.

The gunman, Cho Seung-Hi, had a history of mental illness.
The police searched Cho's cellphone records to see if he had told others about his plan.
They also searched eBay records and found a sale matching Cho's gun and ammunition and issued a search warrant for Cho's eBay account.
Among the dead are an Indonesian and Egyptian students, an Indian professor, and a Holocaust survivor, Liviu Librescu, who died holding Cho at bay so that students could escape.
As students returned to class, there was a solemn ceremony on campus.

Funerals for the 5 young girls shot at the Amish school in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania were held on Thursday and Friday after the shooting on Tuesday.
The Amish community wants to forgive, forget and move on with their lives.
The school where the shooting took place was torn down and a new school is being built very near the old school.
Four of the young girls wounded in the attack have returned to school, the fifth remains in a coma.
A local community group has raised $3.6 million to help the victims, from contributions around the world.

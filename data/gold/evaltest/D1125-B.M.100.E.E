More than 500,000 people commented on a government proposal to list polar bears as ''threatened'' under the Endangered Species Act, reflecting a widespread and unprecedented sense of urgency about their fate.
Studies show worrisome effects on polar bears in different areas, e.g. much smaller and thinner pregnant females than 25 years ago.
Business groups fear listing would impose costs and delays by creating a requirement to limit greenhouse gases.
Shrinkage of sea ice continues apace.
Prospects for the bears appear quite dire.
Some scientists conclude that even major efforts to curb greenhouse gases would not prevent sharp declines or even extinction.

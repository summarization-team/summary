According to the gas company, a gas well near Surabaya, Indonesia that has spewed steaming mud since May 2006, killing 13 people, submerging villages, fields, industries and railroad tracks, was a natural disaster.
Most experts believe the mud leak was caused by technical errors in the company's exploratory drilling.
Scientists believe that, with the pressure from the drilling and the area's geology, the mud is likely to continue for months or years and to pollute the surrounding ocean.
Efforts to stem the flow have proved unsuccessful.
A damages law suit has been filed against the president and the gas company.

In January 2007, the Chinese Food and Drug Administration launched a food safety evaluation in response to citizens' concerns about rising numbers of reports about food poisoning.
A respected report warned that food poisoning affected at least 100,000,000 people a year.
The high amount of tainted food has affected tourism, food exports, and schools, and could affect the Olympics.
In March, the Health Ministry issued a regulation strengthening coordination of food safety inspection in some venues.
In May, the country's cabinet unveiled a food and drug safety five-year plan to inspect and monitor the quality and safety of farm-to-market produce.

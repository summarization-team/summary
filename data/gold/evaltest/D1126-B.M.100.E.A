In Sadr City, Iraq, December 15, 2008, thousands of marchers called for the release of the journalist who threw his shoes at President Bush.
In Syria, he was being hailed as a hero, and in Libya he was given an award for courage.
He has not been formally charged, Iraqi officials said he faces up to seven years in prison for committing an act of aggression against a visiting head of state.
Hitting someone with a shoe is a deep insult in the Arab world.
The Iraqi government and many other Iraqi’s said the incident was shameful.

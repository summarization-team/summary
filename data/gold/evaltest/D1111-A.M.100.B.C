Pekka-Eric Auvinen, a teenager, shot to death 8 people randomly, injured several others, then killed himself at a school in Finland.
The dead included the headmistress and the school nurse.
He had signaled his intentions in a video posted earlier on YouTube.
In the video, Auvinen called for revolution against the system and said he intended to shoot people at his school.
Auvinen had no criminal history and apparently had a normal family life.
Police found a handgun and 500 bullets on his body.
The president and prime minister expressed shock at the shooting and ordered flags flown at half-mast.

On October 2, 2006, a gunman, Charles Roberts, entered an Amish school near Lancaster, PA, took the children hostage, killed five girls and wounded seven other children before killing himself.
His wife said that Roberts, a truck driver from a nearby town, told her he was acting in revenge for something that happened 20 years ago.
He believed that he had molested two relatives.
They denied that this ever happened.
He also had anguish over his infant daughter's death.
Roberts' wife said he was an exceptional father and a loving husband.
The Amish community reached out to Roberts' family.

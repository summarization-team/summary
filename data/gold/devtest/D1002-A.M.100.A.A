On 4 February 1999, four white NYPD officers, McMellon, Carroll, Boss, and Murphy, fired 41 shots at suspected African immigrant criminal Amadou Diallo.
Charged with second degree murder and reckless endangerment, officers pled not guilty but risked 25 years to life.
Judge Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer.
Federal entities, the FBI and Justice Department participated in the investigation.
Both Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton interjected themselves into the trial and 1203 protesters were arrested.
A principal result of the policemen's case was an examination of police attitudes and tactics across the nation.

A tsunami ravaged the northern coast of Papua New Guinea during the night of 17 July 1998, when a magnitude 7.0 undersea earthquake caused a 23 foot wall of water to strike the West Sepik Province villages of Aitape, Nimas, Warapu, Arop, and Teles-Lambu.
Among the area's approximate population of ten thousand, 599 are dead and 6000 homeless from beach abodes constructed of very fragile jungle materials.
The Australian Air Force provided three C130 transports to ferry supplies to the devastated area.
Australia also was sending a mobile hospital and doctors.
Queen Elizabeth sent regrets.

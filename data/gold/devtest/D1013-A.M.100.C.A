Identity theft, assuming another person's identity, is the fastest growing crime in America.
Most thefts involve acquiring Social Security and Credit Card numbers.
Some thieves take pre-approved credit cards from mailboxes, others acquire corporate documents from dumpsters but the main avenue to theft is the computer.
Hackers obtain information from automated medical records, credit records, bank records, property ownership records, and even driving records.
The entire gamut of society can be affected and such thievery is so widespread that support groups are arising for victims.
The victims' financial ruin and emotional distress has led to classifying identity theft a crime.

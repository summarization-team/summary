In 1975.
shortly after passage of the 1973 Endangered Species Act, grizzly bears in Yellowstone and Grand Teton Parks and some adjacent lands were listed as endangered, necessitating protection efforts in the interest of biodiversity.
The listing succeeded with numbers increasing from around 200 in 1982 to near 600 in 2005.
This success led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to propose delisting some parts of the protected area.
The National Resources Council, the Sierra Club, and other groups opposed delisting, citing the encroachment of housing developments and diminished food supply.
A decision about delisting was due mid-February 2006.

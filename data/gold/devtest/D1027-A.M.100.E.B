Trials are scheduled in Laramie, Wyoming for Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney, charged with first degree murder, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery in the October 1998 death of Matthew Shepard, who was gay.
Henderson's trial is scheduled for April 6, McKinney's for August 9.
Both face the death penalty if convicted.
Henderson and McKinney, posing as homosexuals, kidnapped Shepard, pistol whipped him, stole $20, and left him tied to a fence.
Shepard died five days later in hospital.
Jury selection started March 24 for Henderson.
The crime drew national condemnation and calls for stronger bias crime laws.

The term "Eating Disorders" can be subdivided into more specific categories.
In anorexia, sufferers become very thin while believing they are overweight.
In bulimia, affecting 7 million females and 1 million males, sufferers overeat.
Another category, binge eating, is estimated to affect 2% of the population.
A drug, topiramate, has been devised to control this disorder, which like bulimia can lead to diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.
There is also a category designated EDNOS for Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.
Examples of EDNOS include anorexics that do not menstruate, and individuals who purge after taking almost any amount of food.

Amphibians, a species class including frogs, toads, salamanders, and caecilians, are declining world-wide, a development beginning in the late 1980's.
Scientists view amphibians as "canaries in the coal mine", their demise possibly presaging decline of human life.
Threats to amphibian survival include chemically polluted streams, destruction of rain forests, pesticides which can trigger hermaphroditism, climate change, thinning ozone layer, over harvesting for food and medicine, and even the closing of Australia's only frog hospital.
Remedies to decline include creation of parks and reserves, reducing climate change emissions, and breeding amphibians in captivity to sustain vulnerable species.

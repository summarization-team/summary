VIOXX, an arthritis drug used by 2 million people, was withdrawn from the market by Merck, after determination that use past 18 months increased the risk of heart attack or strokes, one researcher estimating a resultant 30,000 to 100,000 deaths.
The withdrawal brought attention to the issues of advertising and FDA oversight.
Critics complained that TV advertising caused arthritics to desire the drug when OTC drugs cost less and worked equally well.
Congress questioned if the FDA devoted sufficient time to approval.
Senator Grassley opined whether there was too cozy an arrangement between the FDA and drug companies.

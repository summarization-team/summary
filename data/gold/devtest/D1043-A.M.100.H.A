On 14 February 2005 in Beirut, former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and eight others were killed by a car bomb.
A previously unknown group, Support and Jihad in Syria and Lebanon, claimed responsibility on Al-Jazeera television, the group citing Hariri's ties to a Saudi Arabia unsympathetic to their brothers.
However, many Lebanese blamed Syria, which regularly interfered in the affairs of Lebanon, where it maintained 14,000 troops.
Syria denied complicity.
France wanted an international investigation, this unwanted by both Saudi Arabia and Lebanon.
The U.S. joined France in seeking the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.

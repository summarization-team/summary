Victor Yushchenko, a candidate for Ukrainian president, first entered a Vienna clinic on 10 September 2004, seriously ill and unable to walk.
This and subsequent clinic visits determined positively that dioxin, a waste product of industrial processes, had been ingested, possibly from spiked soup, which along with questionably refrigerated sushi Yushchenko was served the night of 5 September at a meeting in Kiev.
Yushchenko, whose face shown in many newsphotos was swollen and discolored, accused his political opposition of the poisoning.
Yushchenko lost the election but fraud findings led to another election in December.

The federal trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski began with jury selection in Sacramento on 12 November 1997.
Turned in by mother and brother, the former math instructor was arrested in April 1996, suspected of terrorizing the country in a campaign against technology between 1978-1995, mailing bombs which killed three people and injured twenty-three.
Federal defense attorneys, Quinn Denvir and Judy Clark, entered a plea of innocent, seeking a separate New Jersey trial incorporated into the Sacramento trial.
Attorney General Janet Reno approved seeking the death penalty.
U.S. District Judge Burrell allowed Kaczynski's journals to be used as evidence.

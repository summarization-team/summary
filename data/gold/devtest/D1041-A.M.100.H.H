Coral reefs provide food and shelter for fish, protect shores from erosion, supply seafood for billions of people, and provide livelihoods for millions; but they are threatened by global warming, diseases, overfishing, mud, and pollution.
Only 30% of the world's coral reefs are healthy; 20% have been destroyed and more than 58% are endangered.
More than 15,000 species face extinction unless effective conservation methods are implemented.
The U.S. is helping by improved monitoring, satellite surveillance, accepting an international treaty restricting trade, and $10 million in grants, while Taiwan is creating artificial reefs with discarded utility poles and tires.

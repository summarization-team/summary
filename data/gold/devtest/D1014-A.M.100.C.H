Obesity shortens life.
It can lead to diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebral diseases, and psychological problems.
The World Health Organization says that diabetes will more than double in the next 25 years, partly because of increasing obesity.
Obesity is on the rise in the UK, China, and the Middle East.
As living standards improve, people are less active and have access to a wider variety of foods, including foods high in fat and sugar such as fried foods, chips, sweets, soft drinks, and fast food.
Kuwait, Egypt, and Lebanon have had great success in using hypnotism to combat obesity.

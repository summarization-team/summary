The recent 26 December 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean with destruction of mangrove forests has highlighted their environmental importance.
The trees grow in swampy coastal areas, providing buffers against tsunami caused erosion, providing nurseries for many fish species, providing wood for fuel, boats, and homes,also providing sanctuaries for shorebirds and crab eating monkeys.
Vietnam, India, and Indonesia have long recognized their benefits and have ongoing programs for their protection.
A U.N. agriculture agency pushed for early rehabilitation of mangroves damaged by the tsunami, but warned against overforestation to the detriment of other ecosystems.

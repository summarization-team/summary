In Amsterdam, on 2 November 2004, Theo van Gogh, a descendant of the famed artist, was killed by a Muslim extremist, in apparent retaliation for the showing on TV of Theo's film "Submission", which depicted the spousal abuse of four Muslim women.
The dual Dutch and Moroccan assailant, not further identified, who left a note attached to van Gogh, was arrested immediately after the attack.
The shooting heightened already strained relations between the million Muslim minority and the normally tolerant but now threatened Dutch.
Immigrant groups condemned the slaying but emphasized assimilation was difficult when feeling unwanted.

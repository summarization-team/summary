Mangrove forests thrive near the mouths of large river deltas.
Their roots collect sediment and slow the water's flow, protecting the coastline, preventing erosion, and gradually extending the coastline seaward.
Mangroves also give inhabitants timber, fuel wood and thatch for houses.
Up to half of the world's mangrove swamps have disappeared in the last 20-30 years because of the development of tourist resorts and shrimp farms.
The Asian tsunami of Dec. 26, 2004 gave many examples of shore areas saved by mangroves and of lives and structures destroyed where mangroves had earlier been removed.

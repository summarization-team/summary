After being dormant for eighteen years, Mount Saint Helens in Washington erupted with steam and ash on 1 October 2005 after a series of earthquakes beginning a week earlier.
On 2 October, another burst of steam preceded hour long tremors.
Next day, a tremor lasting twenty-five minutes prompted scientists to warn of a more serious eruption but the nearest residents thirty miles from the crater were not evacuated.
An observatory five miles from the crater was evacuated and aircraft were diverted from the area.
Tourists, however, flocked to the area, many disappointed at the minimal fireworks from the crater.

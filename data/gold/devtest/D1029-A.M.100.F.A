Yearlong uneasiness in Baluchistan erupted on 17 March 2005, a six vehicle convoy attacked by Bugti tribal rebels.
The death toll in the town of Dera Bugti in the southwest Pakistan province was eight soldiers with seven wounded, and twenty-two tribesmen killed and seventy wounded.
Seventeen hindus also died and their temple damaged.
The Frontier Corps then sent troops and two helicopters to quell the uprising.
The goal of the rebels was greater autonomy and increased benefits from the region's resources.
Three thousand government civilians then fled the area, the same number of Bugti women and children also fleeing.

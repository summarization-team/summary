The giant panda population of China, which dwindled to approximately 1100 in the 1980's, has slowly increased to approximately 1890 in the wild.
Their preservation is desired not only in the interest of biodiversity but also because they are considered China's National Gem.
The principal threats to their continued existence are poaching, mining, logging, and diminution of bamboo forests, their main food source.
To counteract such threats, China has established nature reserves, increased forest covers, educated citizens about panda protection, established a panda research center and a blood bank, searched for distressed pandas, and made inter-zoo transfers for biodiversity.

In February 2004, Britain's Food Standards Agency recalled 474 products containing Sudan I, a potentially cancer causing colorant imported from India.
Premier Foods apparently mistakenly added chili powder contaminated with the red dye to Worcester sauce made by them for Crosse and Blackwell, the sauce also incorporated into other recalled foods.
An Italian company testing imports for Sudan I uncovered the problem.
The European Union banned the importation of chili powder containing Sudan I in 2003, the offending ingredient supposedly predating the ban.
The British agency launched an unprecedented probe but also downplayed the risk of severe illness.

On 20 April 1999, a massacre occurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, a suburb of Denver.
Twelve students, one teacher, and the two perpetrators, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who planned the massacre over a two year period, were killed.
The perpetrators, who died from self inflicted wounds, were considered disaffected outcasts, frequently abused by school athletes.
Because of the uneasiness of students, their classes were moved to the neighboring school Chatfield.
Vice President Gore addressed 70,000 attendees at a Memorial Service and Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan cited the incident as rationale for stricter gun laws.

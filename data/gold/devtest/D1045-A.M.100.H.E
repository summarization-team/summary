A petrochemical plant explosion on China's Songhua River resulted in an 80-kilometer odorless, invisible slick of benzene, toxic to humans.
Contingency plans included discharging reservoir water into the river to dilute the pollution, keep the current moving, and prevent the river from freezing.
These efforts helped the benzene concentration to decline.
The city of Harbin, where the river provides drinking water for 3 million people, temporarily cut off its water supply, and residents stockpiled water.
China also warned Russia of polluted tributary water.
Officials summarized past shutdowns and punishments for similar pollution, vowing to take tougher measures in the future.

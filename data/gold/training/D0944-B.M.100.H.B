On March 1, 2005 the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 vote that executing 16-and 17-year olds violates the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Justice Kennedy, the decisive "swing vote" also pointed out in the majority opinion, that the United Stated had been the only remaining nation endorsing the execution of juveniles. Justice Scalia in a dissenting opinion countered that "what the foreign sources 'affirm' is the justices' own notion of how the world ought to be." The court's ruling commutes death sentences to life in prison for 73 inmates in 13 states.

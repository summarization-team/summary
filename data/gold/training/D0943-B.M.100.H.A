A judge acquitted two Indian-Born Canadian Sikhs charged with bombing an Air India jumbo jet, killing 329 people. The unexpected end, after 19 months of a trial that cost $80 million dollars, left the worst case of mass murder in Canadian history an unsettled mystery. The judge, who had presided without a jury, said he did not believe the testimony of witnesses who linked the men to the bombing. The evidence had fallen "markedly short" of the standard required to convict the men. Families of passengers who perished proclaimed a "mockery of justice" and demanded a government investigation.

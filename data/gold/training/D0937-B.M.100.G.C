An Austin Lawyer accidentally shot by Vice President Cheney suffered a minor heart attack February 14 as a result of birdshot in his heart. He is in stable condition and is still expected to fully recover. Doctors are optimistic the pellet won't cause future problems. Democrats accused Cheney of a pattern of secrecy for his delay in reporting the incident. He spoke about the incident in an interview on February 15, calling the day one of the worst of his life and accepting full blame for the accident. A Texas sheriff's office cleared Cheney of any wrongdoing in the incident.

On June 27, 2005 the Supreme Court, in a pair of 5-4 rulings, found that the display of the Ten Commandments (T.C.) in a park at the Texas State Capitol was proper, but the displays in the County Courthouses in Kentucky were so overtly religious as to be impermissible. The rulings made it clear that such disputes must be decided case by case with specific facts determining whether there is a violation of the Establishment Clause. Justice Breyer was the swing vote as the only justice voting with the majority in both cases.

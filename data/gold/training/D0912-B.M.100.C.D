Six days after Cindy Sheehan arrived in Texas more than 350 protestors, including members of Code Pink and True Majority, and over 100 people supporting President Bush had converged on Camp Casey, Sheehan's Texas encampment. Sheehan continued her protests and received support from liberal groups. She announced plans for 1000 candlelight protest vigils nationwide. Sheehan stated she would continue her anti-war activities for the duration of Bush's vacation unless he met with her. Sheehan was savvy in using the media for her cause. She sought to embarrass the President as a strategy to advance her political objective.

President Bush nominated a conservative favorite, appellate court judge John Roberts, to the US Supreme Court to replace O'Connor. In doing so he resisted pressure to name a woman or Hispanic. O'Connor was a crucial swing vote on the court. Liberals fear and conservatives hope that Roberts' s confirmation will move the court decidedly to the right O'Connor said of Roberts: "He's good in every way, except he's not a woman". Pro-choice activists indicated opposition to Roberts who, as a lawyer in the first Bush Administration, helped write a brief that argued Roe v. Wade should be overturned.

Betty Friedan was a brilliant, visionary woman who came to prominence in 1963 with publication of her book, The Feminine Mystique. The wildly popular book brought about a re-examination of women's role in society. Friedan found that many women were not content with lives of domesticity, and she campaigned for greater access to work outside the home. She was the first president of the National Organization for Women and a leader in the drive to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. She was abrasive, and some feminists criticized her for ignoring concerns of women of color, lesbians and the poor.

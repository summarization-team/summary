Swedish authorities are investigating a former KKK leader and US politician for racial law violations after he delivered a speech to a neo-Nazi gathering there. White supremacists are suspected in the killing of a Jewish Defense League activist in a federal prison. Neo-Nazis staged rallied at City Hall in Toledo, Ohio. To avoid violence, about 700 police were deployed, community leaders promised counterdemonstrations would be peaceful, and rally-related activities were confined to City Hall grounds. In a Sydney, Australia, thousands of white youths, including white supremacists and neo-Nazis, attacked Middle Eastern-looking beachgoers. Some 2,000 police were deployed to maintain order.

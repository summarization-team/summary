The U.S. Energy Department announced that an experimental carbon sequestration project had been successful. CO2 from a coal burning plant in North Dakota was pumped to an oilfield in Canada. The test removed five million tons of CO2. Subsidiaries of BP and Edison International planned to build a $1 billion power plant in California that would capture 90% of the carbon dioxide produced and pump it into an oilfield. Oil companies Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC announced plans for similar plants. A pilot energy plant in Denmark using similar technology was scheduled to start in March 2006.

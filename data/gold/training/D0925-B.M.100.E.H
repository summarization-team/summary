On 10 January, six months ahead of schedule, Apple introduced two new Intel-based computers, an iMac and a laptop called the MacBook Pro. The new iMac is two to three times faster than the old model, while the laptop is four to five times faster, although they cost the same as the old models. Software developers are working on programs that will run on both the Intel and the older Macs. Although the processors inside are the same as those used on Windows-based PCs, the new Macs will not be able to run Windows software.

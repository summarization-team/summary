In late August, the IRA ordered an end to its armed campaign in Northern Ireland, declaring there is an alternate way to achieve a united Ireland, free from British rule. If this pledge holds, it will be a historic turning point in the violent history of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The majority Protestant party is expected to demand a one year delay in power sharing. Other remaining questions are will the IRA end criminal operations, will the Catholics support the new police, and will the promised destruction of the massive IRA weapons stash occur. World leaders praised the IRA order.

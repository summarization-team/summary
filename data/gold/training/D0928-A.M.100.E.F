The first unfocused, lengthy trial of Tyco executives Kozlowski and Swartz for stealing $600 million from Tyco was aborted after juror intimidation. The judge ruled a claim on behalf of Tyco was barred under Bermuda law, but allowed a class action lawsuit by Tyco shareholders. He refused to separate the two men's cases or allegations of accounting fraud and looting. In the retrial, prosecutors are concentrating on accusations that the men hid unauthorized bonuses, secretly forgave loans to themselves, and lied about Tyco's finances to inflate stock before selling it. The defense is trying to discredit the board of directors.

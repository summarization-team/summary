The retired Tyco board chairman said he was never told about millions in forgiven loans and bonuses for Kozlowski. The former finance VP said he was unaware of compensation committee approval for the bonuses. Kozlowski took the stand in his retrial. He said deceased compensation committee head Phillip Hampton had approved the bonuses. Kozlowski thought a $20 million fee he paid a board member for arranging an acquisition did not require board authorization. Not including forgiven debt on his tax form was an oversight. His assistant decided to use Tyco loan money for certain payments but Kozlowski conceded his responsibility.

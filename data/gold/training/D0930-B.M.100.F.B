In Sept. 2005 a United Nations report said that application of carbon sequestration to power plants would become economical and that 99 percent of the carbon would not leak during the next 1000 years. In November the U.S. Department of Energy revealed than an experimental project with sequestration in a live oil field brought more oil to the surface. In 2006 plans were announced for similar projects in Britain and Norway with a Norwegian expert saying their project could increase oil recovery by at least 155 million barrels in its lifetime.

On 6 June Apple Computer announced plans to abandon its 14-year ties with IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors. Apple had been frustrated by IBM's inability to develop a chip that could process large amounts of data without overheating. Apple programs will have to be rewritten to run on an Intel-powered Mac, although engineers have already developed codes to ease the transition. Apple could lose sales in the short term, as people wait for the switch. The first Intel-powered Macs are scheduled for June 2006; all Macs should be converted by the end of 2007.

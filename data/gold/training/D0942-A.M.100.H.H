Taiwan considers the PRC's plan to enact an anti-secession law a provocative move to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Emphasizing that Taiwan is not a part of the PRC as Beijing claims, Taiwan believes the legislation is aimed at establishing a legal justification for Beijing's invasion of the island. The U.S. and E.U.consider the legislation counterproductive to peace. The PRC claims that the law is designed to check the secessionist activities of "Taiwan independence" forces and promote China's reunification. The PRC legislature is scheduled to take up the anti-secession law in March.

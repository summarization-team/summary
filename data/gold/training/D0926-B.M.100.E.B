At 0400GMT March 2 over India a reading showed that just 9600 lbs. of fuel remained of the 19,000 lbs at takeoff. Mission control reported a fuel shortage: 2600 lbs. less than they had figured. Fossett decided to press on to Hawaii admitting the fuel problem was "a huge setback." Before reaching Hawaii he announced that he would continue on to Salina. By 0930GMT March 3 Global Flyer was southwest of California and that afternoon, after 67 hours in flight, Fossett glided into a perfect landing to the cheers of all of Salina and much of the world.

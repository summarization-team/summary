In late 2004 Hong Kong proposed that supermarkets provide incentives to customers to use fewer plastic bags and by early 2006 was considering prohibiting free distribution. During 2005 Japan drafted a plan to ban free distribution and the Indian state of Maharashtra banned sale or use of the bags with the support of environmentalists and cooperation of the plastic industry. Bangladesh called for stricter enforcement of its restrictions and launched a campaign to popularizing use of jute bags. France began a drive urging the public not to throw out so much plastic trash.

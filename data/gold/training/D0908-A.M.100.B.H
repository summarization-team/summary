Most countries, including the U.S., Britain, India, and Japan, have condemned Nepali King Gyanendra's seizure of power. The U.S. has not yet decided whether to continue its military and development aid. India has not yet commented on its military aid but is expected to continue to support Nepal's fight against the Maoist rebels. Both the E.U. and the U.N. condemned the move and called for an immediate return to multi-party democracy. International organizations including Amnesty International have denounced the suspension of civil liberties. China alone remained neutral, maintaining that this was an "internal matter."

Pakistan's President Musharraf and India's Prime Minister Singh met for talks in New Delhi in April 2005. Musharraf pronounced the peace process, begun in January 2004, as "irreversible." India and Pakistan agreed to open bank branches in each other's countries. Trade rose to $600 million in 2005, and they pledged improvement in air and shipping services. They also agreed to notify each other in advance of ballistic missile tests. Prime Minister Singh invited Kashmir's separatists for peace talks, a critical move toward pushing forward the peace process. They had previously been excluded from the talks between India and Pakistan.

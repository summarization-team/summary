HK and Disney agreed to build the park in 1999, with HK majority owner. Construction began in 2003. On opening day, Sept. 12, 2005, 16,000 people attended and demonstrators protested labor abuses at Chinese factories making Disney products. Park workers describe long hours, long travel times, harsh turnarounds and lack of breaks. Activists want HK Disneyland workers to unionize but Disney resists, despite unions at US and French Disneylands. Disney denies low attendance and is criticized for lack of transparency. Disney offered local residents discounted tickets. Mainland China, expected to be the major source of visitors, provided only 25 percent.

In February 2005, Yusuf Islam said he had obtained "substantial damages" against two British newspapers which alleged he had been involved in terrorism. The dispute was sparked by Islam's deportation from the U.S. After the 2005 London bombings, Islam said the true meaning of Islam should be taught to Muslim children to discourage extremism. He was founder of the Islamiya Primary School. Islam gave a concert in Jakarta to raise cash for tsunami victims of 2005. He recorded a new song, "Indian Ocean," in response to the disaster and opened an office of his own charity in Indonesia.

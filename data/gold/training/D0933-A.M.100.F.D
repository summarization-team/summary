Research shows a strong link between schizophrenics and their fathers' age, demonstrating a hereditary factor exacerbated by sperm mutations that accumulate with age. Australian researchers linked the impaired thought process involved with schizophrenia to the thinning of grey matter in the brain. A growing body of research indicates that years of heavy marijuana (also known as cannabis) use significantly increases the risk of developing schizophrenia. The malfunction of certain microcircuits in the brain may cause schizophrenia. A study suggests that the epignome may hold a clue to schizophrenia's nongenetic aspects.

Recent studies demonstrate that schizophrenia has a genetic basis and results from chemical abnormalities in the brain. The long-standing belief in problems of childhood as a cause has been largely discarded, but environmental factors are still seen as playing a role. Famine, malnutrition, or infection of a pregnant woman may cause changes in a developing fetal brain and heavy smoking of marijuana by teenagers may trigger a genetic predisposition. One study identifies insulin as a factor. The same 14 genes found missing in the brains of schizophrenics were missing in the muscles of diabetics.

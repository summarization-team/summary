Cindy Sheehan is receiving more support as her vigil continues. The number of protestors rose to 350 and the pro-Bush contingent reached 250, creating parking problems and traffic jams. The road encampment included 100's of white crosses representing those killed in Iraq. Someone knocked over many of these crosses, drawing outrage. On August 17, the protestors began moving to land provided by one of Bush's neighbors, where they will have more parking available. Nearly 1,000 candlelight vigils were planned to occur nationwide that evening. Sheehan also is getting public relations advice and is refusing to pay her taxes.

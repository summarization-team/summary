In April 19, the new pope was elected on the fourth ballot, signaled by the white smoke and tolling bells. Following the election, Joseph Ratzinger accepted and announced his papal name, Benedict XVI. He was then taken to a dressing chamber nicknamed the "Room of Tears", where he donned the papal vestments. A Chilean cardinal then proclaimed "We have a pope!" from the central balcony over St. Peter's Square where thousands of pilgrims were gathering. Pope Benedict then appeared and made a brief speech. The electing cardinals were on surrounding balconies.

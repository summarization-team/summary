The PRC claims the anti-secession law to be deliberated by its legislative body in March is aimed at promoting a peaceful reunification with Taiwan. It denies that it would be used to justify military action. The PRC maintains that the one country, two systems approach is best for Taiwan. Taiwan fears the anti-secession law is designed to legalize a Beijing military invasion. It says it is a provocation that would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait. Its ruling and opposition parties agreed to adopt a resolution against the Beijing law. The US and EU support Taiwan's position.

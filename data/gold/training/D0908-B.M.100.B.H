The U.S., the E.U., India, and Norway recalled their ambassadors to protest the king's seizure of power. On March 7th, Japan, urging a return to democracy, announced 7.1 million dollars of aid to Nepal, but as of March 10th, the World Bank had frozen the release of more aid to Nepal, India and Britain had suspended their military aid, and the U.S. and Norway were considering similar action. Nine U.N. human rights experts have expressed deep concern over the king's actions and the International Federation of Journalists has asserted that Nepal's media have been "suffocated."

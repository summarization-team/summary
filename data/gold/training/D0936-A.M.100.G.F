Sandra O'Connor, 75, appointed to the Supreme Court by Reagan in 1981 and first woman on the court, announced her retirement, effective on confirmation of her successor. She will spend time with her Alzheimer's-patient husband. Bush promised to be deliberate, thorough, and timely in choosing a successor; to have no litmus test on abortion or gay marriage; and to pick a strict constitutionist who will not legislate from the bench. This first vacancy in 11 years gives Bush the chance to shape court ideological balance. O'Connor was a frequent swing vote. Bush chastised critics of Alberto Gonzales as a candidate.

Congress began consideration of Patriot Act (PA) renewal on April 4, 2005. By then 5 states and 375 county and city governments had passed resolutions warning of the Act's excesses. Senators Craig (R-ID) and Durbin (D-IL) had drafted The Safety and Freedom Enforcement Act (SAFE) eliminating the three main targets of the civil libertarians. The Administration pushed for making the entire PA permanent. Testimony by the Attorney General and FBI Director opened the debate. By June the Administration's case was made in draft legislation offered by Sen. Roberts (R-KS) further strengthening federal powers and countering SAFE.

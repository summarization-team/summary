In the days leading up to the January 30, 2005 elections in Iraq, more than 100 of the more than 5,000 polling places across the nation were attacked, with many of those destroyed. Although 400 Iraqi were reportedly killed in January as part of the anti-election campaign, casualties at the polling places were limited because many were empty. The attacks ranged from car-suicide bombers, to small bombs, mortars and bullets, to posters and pamphlets. The threats to the polling places came from guerilla and militant groups, to include Al-Qaeda and mujahedeen factions. They promised more violence on election day.

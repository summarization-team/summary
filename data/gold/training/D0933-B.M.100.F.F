Vitamin A, possibly proteins PDE4B and DISC1, and reduced GABA and insulin levels play roles in schizophrenia. Dopamine is linked to schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations. Other brain chemicals contribute to confusion and emotional unresponsiveness. Smoking pot in adolescence increases schizophrenic risk. Fourteen genes are missing in schizophrenics' brains.

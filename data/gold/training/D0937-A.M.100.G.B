On Feb. 11, 2006 Vice President Cheney shot a hunting companion in Texas. Cheney turned and fired at a covey of birds, not realizing that his friend, Whittington, was in the line of fire. Whittington was immediately treated and hospitalized. The accident was reported by a local newspaper the following day and only then did Cheney's office confirm the event, 20 hours after it happened. Controversy surrounds the event. Who was at fault? Why didn't the White House announce the accident sooner? Cheney handled the matter of an illegal hunting license by mailing a $7 check to Texas.

Israeli officials strongly suspect the al-Qaida network in the three Sinai Peninsula resort blasts based on similarities with past attacks. Another previously unknown group, Islamic Unity Brigades, claimed responsibility for the series of bombings, supposedly as revenge for Israel's assassination of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in March. Both a car bomb and a suicide bomber struck the Taba Hilton at about 10:00 p.m. Car bombs are suspected in the blasts which struck just before midnight at the Ras Shytan and Nuweiba resorts. Accounts of the dead and wounded varied throughout the rescue effort.

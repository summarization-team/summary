After the explosion many Israelis immediately fled across the border. The Egyptians facilitated the evacuation. Egyptian authorities cooperated with Israeli fire and rescue personnel, allowing ambulances to cross the border to evacuate the wounded and search for those trapped in the debris. Two groups, one calling itself the Islamic Unity Brigade and a previously unknown pro-Al Qaeda Islamic group called Islamic Tawhid Brigades, claimed responsibility for the bombings. Neither group offered details of how it carried out the attack. Their claims could not be verified. Israel's deputy defense minister believed Al Qaeda terrorist network was involved.

The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the display of the Ten Commandments on Texas Capitol grounds did not violate constitutional principles. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the court and was joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Breyer. Justices O'Connor, Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg dissented. In the Kentucky case, the prevailing opinion was that the Commandments display in two county courthouses was overtly religious and thus impermissible. Justice Souter wrote the opinion and was joined by Justices Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg and Breyer. The rulings conveyed the message that disputes over religious displays must be decided on a case by case.

Bobby Fischer, the former chess grand master, was arrested in 2005 for trying to leave Japan on a revoked U.S. passport. Japan planned to deport him to the U.S., where he was wanted for ignoring sanctions against Yugoslavia. It meant 10 years in jail. Iceland intervened, and Japan agreed not to deport Fischer if Iceland would give him citizenship. Iceland furnished him a special passport and residency permit. Japan insisted on full citizenship, which was finally granted. Iceland revered Fischer because it was there that he defeated Boris Spassky, the Russian chess champion, in 1972, during the cold war.

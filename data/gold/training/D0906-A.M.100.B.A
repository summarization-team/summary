In January 2005, rescue workers in southern California used snowplows, snowcats and snowmobiles to free people from a highway where snow, sleet, rain and fog caused a 200-vehicle logjam. A fourth day of storms took a heavy toll as saturated hillsides gave way, mudslides inundating houses and closing highways. People fled neighborhoods up and down the coast. Eight of nine horse races at Santa Anita were canceled for the first time in 10 years. More than 6,000 houses were without power in Los Angeles. A scientist said Los Angeles had not seen such intensity of winter downpours since 1889-90.

During November 2004, India's prime minister reduced troops on the Kashmir border as a goodwill gesture prior to his visit. While there, he met with Kashmiri separatist leaders. India rejected a Pakistani suggestion that some Kashmir areas be made independent, placed under joint control, or put under UN administration. The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers were to meet in New Delhi to further the peace process begun in January and facilitated by a year-long ceasefire. Consequently, on April 7, 2005, limited bi-weekly bus service between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of Kashmir resumed for the first time in 57 years.

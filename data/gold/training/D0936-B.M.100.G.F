Bush nominated conservative federal appeals court Judge John G. Roberts, 50, to replace Sandra O'Connor. Liberals and abortion rights supporters immediately mobilized their opposition. Conservatives began their campaign to support Roberts before he was announced. Both sides have spent years preparing for this, poring over records of potential nominees and amassing war chests. Roberts has been a judge for only two years but was considered fair. Roberts has argued that Roe vs. Wade was wrongly decided and ruled that special military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay could proceed. Roberts was expected to be confirmed. Bush passed over even more conservative candidates.

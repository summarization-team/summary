On July 19, Bush named John G. Roberts, Jr. to replace Justice O'Connor. Roberts graduated from Harvard Law School, clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist, and worked in two Republican administrations. He has been a judge on the federal appeals court for one year, creating no record on controversial subjects such as abortion and federalism. The release of some documents from his White House service is expected. Many regret that he is a white male, as were all but four of past nominees. Although liberals and conservatives are ready for a fight in the Senate, intense acrimony is not expected.

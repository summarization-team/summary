White supremacists often travel cross-country staging protests. An Arkansas-based group protested in Boston. A Virginia-based group marched in Toledo, Ohio. Neo-Nazis urged followers to travel to Crawford, Texas to protest the Iraq war. One neo-Nazi leader plotted to kill a federal judge. White supremacists spread their word through books and internet postings, often quoting King and other civil rights leaders to advance their own agendas. To avoid violent clashes, community leaders have pleaded for calm, staged peace rallies and delayed announcing protest routes.

Expecting an official announcement of Yasser Arafat's death on Wednesday, November 10, Palestinians made plans and preparations for his funeral. A Muslim cleric flew to Paris to be with the Palestinian leader who remained in a coma and suffered liver and kidney failure. Arafat died at 3:30 a.m., November 11. His body would be flown to Cairo for a memorial service there scheduled for Friday. After the service, his body would be flown to Ramallah for burial at his headquarters there. Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip for security. The Palestinian Authority declared a 40-day mourning period.

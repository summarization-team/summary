Japanese and Norwegian diplomats visited Sri Lanka in October 2004 in an effort to persuade the government and Tamil Tiger rebels to resume negotiations toward an end to hostilities. The Tigers insisted they had not given up their right to secede, although they agreed to explore federal solutions. Increasing violence preceding the visit of the Norwegian foreign minister forced the government to heighten security measures. The Tigers blamed the violence on elements who wanted to discredit them. In November, the government accused Tamil Tigers of breaking a Norwegian-arranged ceasefire by killing a government soldier and a military informant.

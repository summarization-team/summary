By April 2005 five states were in revolt against the Patriot Act, urging that restrictions be placed on its broad powers. The "library provision" that allowed searching of library records, caused five states and 375 communities in 43 states to pass anti-Patriot Act resolutions, the ACLU said. Nevertheless, the Bush administration continued its campaign to preserve the Patriot Act and even to expand it. Congress considered legislation that could enlarge the FBI's ability to wiretap people whom it suspected were security risks. Also, it would lift a restriction on special warrants, that information obtained must be related to terrorism.

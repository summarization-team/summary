Record-breaking rains brought danger and destruction to southern California in the first weeks of 2005. The early January storms dropped more rain in Los Angeles than its average annual amount. Several thousand residents endured power outages. Conditions necessitated widespread evacuations. Landslides, mudslides, floods and downed trees caused massive destruction of homes and roads. Stranded motorists required rescue by overtaxed emergency workers. Schools, businesses, rail lines and roads were closed. Beaches were closed for sewage leaks. The number of traffic accidents tripled from the previous dry weekend. In all, the storms caused at least 20 deaths and dozens of injuries.

India's western state of Maharashtra has joined other Indian states in banning the manufacture, sale, and use of plastic bags. Taiwan originally banned most businesses from offering plastic bags, but in January lifted the ban to allow bistros and restaurants to provide bags free of charge, a move sharply criticized by conservationists. A third Hong Kong supermarket chain voluntarily agreed to reduce distribution of plastic bags. Japan was considering a ban on the free distribution of plastic bags. Kenya's largest supermarket has begun using new biodegradable plastic bags. The French Ecology Ministry urged the public not to use plastic bags.

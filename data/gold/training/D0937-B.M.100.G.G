A buckshot pellet caused Whittington to suffer atrial fibrillation and a "silent" heart attack by the morning of February 14. He was returned to intensive care. Between 5 and 200 pellets are lodged in his body. He's expected to remain hospitalized for a week.

On the afternoon of the 15th during a FOX News interview, Cheney accepted blame for the shooting, but defended the information handling.

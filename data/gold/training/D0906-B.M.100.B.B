Good weather in Southern California on Jan. 13, 2005 was accompanied by a massive cleanup effort as crews cleared mud, rubble and debris. It had been the wettest 15 days on record. Countless roads were closed, Amtrak service was disrupted and in La Conchita the entire town of 260 people had been evacuated. February 12-23 another rainstorm hit Southern California. Los Angeles had 9.14 inches of rain with a repetition of floods, mudslides, and sinkholes. Six deaths were reported. Los Angeles County estimated the cost of the two storms to its roads and facilities at $52.5 million.

Iceland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan have all banned or heavily taxed plastic bags. Eritrea has enacted fines for all who import, produce, distribute, or sell them. Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda are all considering bans or taxes as are the citizens of San Francisco and Los Angeles. In Rwanda some citizens consider the government too hostile and ask "what should we use instead". A survey in San Francisco found about 1/3 supporting a tax, 1/3 opposed and 1/3 somewhat open minded. Grocers and plastic industry personnel are opposed while environmentalists support the tax.

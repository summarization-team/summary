According to The Times, senior advisors told Prince Charles that he must either marry Parker Bowles or banish her from his life to avoid a constitutional crisis should he become king. If he became king, she would have the title of Princess Consort, a vague title that would let her develop her role over time.

The Prime Minister announced that the marriage would not cause Australia to abandon the British monarch as head of state.

After her son died in Iraq, Cindy Sheehan began protesting the war. She founded the Gold Star Families for Peace and began making appearances and leading protests around the country. On August 6, 2005, she led protestors to Crawford, Texas, demanding to meet with the President. Two officials met with her, but she set up a vigil and swore to continue until Bush personally met with her, even if she had to go to Washington. This protest drew world-wide media attention and garnered support from other anti-war activists. She took her protest to the internet with a conference with bloggers.

Despite improved economic and cultural relations, India and Pakistan have made little progress on the problem of Kashmir. However, leaders of both countries remain committed to the peace process. They planned formal talks on the subject in New Delhi on April 17, their first since India's Prime Minister Singh took office last May. On April 16, moderate Kashmiri separatist leaders were to meet with the Pakistani president in New Delhi. In June, they made a historic trip to Pakistan and met with Pakistani government officials. India's Prime Minister Singh invited them for peace talks to be held on September 5.

While hearing arguments, Supreme Court justices seemed to grapple for a standard which would keep the government from endorsing a religion without eradicating America's historical and cultural ties to religion. On June 27, the court ruled that displaying the Ten Commandments on government property does not necessarily violate the constitutional principle of separation between church and state. They ruled that the monument displayed at the Texas Capitol, one of thousands donated across the country and displayed along with 16 other secular sculptures, was proper. However, they ruled that the courthouse displays in Kentucky were overtly religious and therefore impermissible.

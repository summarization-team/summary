Betty Friedan's 1963 classic "The Feminine Mystique" started a social revolution that led to the modern women's movement. It was included in Human Events magazine's list of the "Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th centuries." Frieden helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966 and was one of the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus. In 1970, she led a 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality down Fifth Avenue. Friedan pushed for equal pay, sex-neutral help-wanted ads, maternity leave, child-care centers for working parents, and other topics considered radical at the time.

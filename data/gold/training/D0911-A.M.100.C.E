Bobby Fischer can avoid deportation from Japan to the US if Iceland upgrades its granting residency to full citizenship. Fischer is popular in Iceland where he beat the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky to become world chess champ in 1972. Fischer faces charges in the US for violating sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia for playing there in 1992, and possibly for tax evasion. Fischer wants to marry the head of Japan's chess association. Since leaving the US, Fischer has ranted against the US and Jews. The Icelandic Parliament has granted citizenship to Fischer where he is expected to reside.

On March 31, 2005, Senate Democrats questioned the nominee for FDA chief on the lack of a decision on over-the-counter (OTC) sales of the morning-after pill, recommended by his staff and available with a prescription since the 1990's. He called the delay complex. Six states already allow OTC sales, with politicians in other states campaigning on this question. Discussions are heating up over pharmacists refusing to dispense this pill, even with a prescription. Four states have laws giving them that right and 11 states are considering this legislation. One pharmacist is suing the Governor of Illinois for this capability.

Merck withdrew Vioxx when a study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks. An FDA study estimates Vioxx may have caused 27,785 attacks/deaths since its approval. The medical community was concerned about use of related drug use and sought more guidance. Lawyers estimated thousands of lawsuits would be filed against Merck. One settlement estimate was $12 billion. Merck's costs to withdraw Vioxx from the market were $552.6 million and their profits for the third quarter of 2004 dropped 29 percent. Several medical reports criticized Merck's failing to stop Vioxx when data first showed its potential danger.

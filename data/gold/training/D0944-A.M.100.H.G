The Supreme Court heard arguments on Roper v Simmons on October 13, 2004. Its decision will determine whether the death penalty can be given for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds. The court ended the death penalty for those 15 and younger in 1988 and mentally retarded in 2002. The outcome appears dependent on the votes of Justices O'Connor and Kennedy. Key issues are has the nation's consensus changed, should world consensus influence US law, and the brain development of these youngsters. Since 1976, 22 have been executed. Now 73 people are on death row in 12 states.

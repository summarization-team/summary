On July 26 Ireland's deputy prime minister predicted news of a response from the IRA later in the week. The next day senior figures in Sinn Fein departed for the U.S. signaling a forthcoming announcement. An Irish government spokesman warned that an IRA commitment to non-violence had to be backed by an unambiguous process for disposing of all of its weapons. On July 29 the long-awaited statement arrived declaring that "All IRA units have been ordered to dump arms." U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan hailed the announcement while British Prime Minister Blair called it a "very positive" statement.

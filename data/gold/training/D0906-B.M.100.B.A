Southern California was just recovering from the January 2005 storms in February, when another severe winter storm pummeled the state for six days. Sodden hillsides collapsed, sending some houses sliding down slopes and mud toppling others. The rains killed nine people, destroyed dozens of houses, flooded roads and airports, and cut power for thousands. When the rain stopped, emergency crews began the cleanup, working to clear 20 major roads and fill thousands of potholes, some the size of cars. Engineers assessed whether houses were still habitable. Some ambulance crews were diverted to work spotting signs of flooding and mudslides.

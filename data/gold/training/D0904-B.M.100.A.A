A neo-Nazi group staged a rally in Toledo in December 2005. Large numbers of police prevented violence. Two months earlier the group had caused a riot when they announced plans for such a rally. More than 30 people were killed in Australia when mobs of drunken white youths attacked people of Middle Eastern appearance at a beach in Sydney. In Wilmington, N.C., a state-appointed Race Riot Commission found that in 1898, violence was part of the successful effort of white supremacists to disenfranchise blacks, some of whom held high public office. An unknown number of black residents were killed.

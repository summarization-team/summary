New evidence surfaced indicating A.Q. Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and other countries. He also played a bigger role than previously disclosed in Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs, delivering bomb-building materials, including high-speed centrifuges and designs. Investigators believe he's traveled to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Niger. The purpose of the trips is unclear. Khan's deputy, in custody in Malaysia, has provided information of his activities. Pakistan dismissed recent evidence as baseless, but said its probe into Khan's activities continues. Foreign authorities are still banned from questioning him, but Pakistani authorities relay questions to him.

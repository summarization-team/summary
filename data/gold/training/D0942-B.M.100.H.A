The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan condemned Beijing for passing the Anti-Secession law targeting Taiwan on March 14. Its statement said the move severely infringes upon the freedom, dignity and security of the Taiwan people. The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are two separate political entities, it said, and Taiwan's sovereignty should be respected by the PRC. The White House branded "unfortunate" China's adoption of the anti-secession law. US lawmakers expressed "grave concern." Many nations expressed approval, including France, Cuba, Kenya, Kuwait, Cambodia, Zambia, Cameroon and other African countries.

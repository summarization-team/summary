On January 19, new images of Jill Carroll surrounded by masked gunmen of the so-called Revenge Brigade were aired. Among those pleading for Carroll's release were her mother and Iraqi Muslim leaders. A US-based Islamic rights group sent representatives to Baghdad on her behalf. US Senator John Kerry discussed her plight with Iraqi officials during his visit to Iraq. Iraq's justice ministry announced that six of eight women detainees were due to be release within a week based on a review of their cases. Iraqi and US officials deny the releases would be in response to the captors' demands.

On Iraq's election day, voting center attacks claimed at least six lives. A series of blasts around Baghdad included a suicide bombing which killed one and wounded four. A mortar attack killed four and wounded seven in the Shiite slum of Sadr City. In Basra, a mortar exploded, but no casualties were reported. Balad suffered two mortar attacks. One voter was killed, and a child wounded. In sharp contrast, no one went to vote in Fallujah. Most people said they were afraid. In the past days, insurgents have targeted the polling centers in Anbar province, where Fallujah is situated.

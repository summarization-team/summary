Peter Jennings died from his lung cancer on August 7. He never appeared on the news after the taped April announcement. His treatments, which included radiation beginning in May, were too debilitating. He had lost 20 pounds the first month. Only 42% of lung cancer victims survive for at least one year. His death drew appreciation from national leaders, colleagues, and viewers. Two thousand people attended his September memorial service.

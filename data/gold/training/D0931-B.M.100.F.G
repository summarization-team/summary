In February 2005, Time magazine reported that A. Q. Khan also had provided nuclear equipment to Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations. It stated that Khan had earned up to $400 million and his network was still active. The magazine also reported that cylinders of a gas, critical to uranium enrichment, were missing from a Pakistani nuclear laboratory. Pakistani officials called the report baseless and part of a disinformation campaign.

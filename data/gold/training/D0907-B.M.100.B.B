Although John Yoo is best known for his 2001-2003 Justice Dept. memos, he has actively expressed his views in later years. He offered his opinion on the nominations of Supreme Court Justices. He urged the U.S. to be more ruthless and cunning in the fight against terrorism setting up fake terrorist organizations that would make fake attacks and compete with al-Qaida for recruits. He contends that the U.S. has the right to hold "enemy combatants" indefinitely without charges or lawyers and that the President has the power to unilaterally start a war and overrule the Geneva Convention.

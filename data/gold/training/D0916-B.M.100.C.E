Iraq's justice ministry said six of eight women detainees would be released within days but denied any link with kidnappers demands. Carroll's mother made an impassioned plea for her release on behalf of the family. A leading US-based Islamic rights group was sending representatives to Baghdad seeking the release of Carroll. The White House said Carroll's safe return is a priority. Iraq's main Sunni Arab party called for Carroll's release. Senator John Kerry said the fate of Carroll overshadowed his visit to Iraq.

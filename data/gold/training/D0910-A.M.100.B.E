A group from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam met in Switzerland to prepare for talks with the Sri Lankan government. A cease in that country brokered by Norway has been observed since February 2002; however, internecine clashes between the LTTE and rival groups counter efforts to revive negotiations between the government and the LTTE. The Sri Lankan government has sent counterproposals to the Interim Self Government to those put forward by the LTTE. Violence continues and a Swiss national was killed. Japanese envoy Akashi was to arrive in Sri Lanka to push for resumption of talks.

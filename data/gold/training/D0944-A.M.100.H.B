Roper vs. Simmons presented the Supreme Court a chance to strike down the death penalty for crimes committed by 16-17-year-olds. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer were expected to vote against the death penalty while Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas would be for it. Justices Kennedy and O'Connor appeared to be "swing votes." In the initial hearing Kennedy expressed concerns about exempting 16-17-year-olds but also noted that "world opinion is against us" in executing juveniles. O'Connor noted that several states had already raised the minimum age for execution to 18.

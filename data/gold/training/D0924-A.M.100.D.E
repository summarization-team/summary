Merck has recalled its popular arthritis medicine Vioxx. Use of Vioxx may increase risk of stroke and heart attack. This is the largest prescription drug recall in history and could lead to an onslaught of lawsuits. Vioxx is used by 1.3 million Americans and 700,000 in other countries and accounts for sales of $2.5B. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canadian Provinces. Hundreds of plaintiffs lawyers expected to meet in Las Vegas to plan class action strategy. The US Food and Drug Administration estimates Vioxx could have caused more than 27,000 heart attacks. Merck income has dropped 29%.

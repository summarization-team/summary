Steve Fossett continued his non-stop, solo flight, reaching the half-way point over Myanmar at 0705 GMT on Wednesday. Over China there was concern about the fuel supply, but he decided to continue to Hawaii and at 2000 was east of Japan. As he was north of Hawaii, he again decided to continue because the jet stream was so strong. By 0930 on Thursday, he was 1,151 miles southwest of California. He landed at Salina, Kansas, at 1948 GMT. He had taken just over 67 hours to fly a 23,000 mile zigzag course around the world.

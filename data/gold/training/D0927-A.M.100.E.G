Peter Jennings hoarsely announced he had lung cancer on April 5, 2005 and would begin outpatient chemotherapy in New York. A former heavy smoker, he had had health problems since late 2004. Medical experts speculated, since he was not having surgery, that the cancer was advanced or of the small-cell type. Americans responded with sympathy. Other cancer victims considered him a role model. Although he had hoped to continue working, he went on a leave-of-absence in late April. The last of the "old time" announcers, Jennings' illness stunned viewers and leaves ABC scrambling to find fill-ins and perhaps a replacement.

Prosecutors in the trial of Kozlowski and Swartz say the two stole $150M by improperly forgiving company loans to themselves, taking unauthorized bonuses and having Tyco pay personal expenses. In a surprise move, Kozlowski testified in his own defense. He portrayed himself as an earnest, often harried, executive who rose through the ranks and had the support of the company's board. He could not explain why a $25M bonus did not appear on his tax return. Kozlowski finished four days of testimony insisting that he left it to lawyers and accountants to decide what to tell shareholders about his compensation.

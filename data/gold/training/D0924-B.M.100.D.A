In November, 2004, government and expert witnesses told a Senate committee that Federal regulators and Merck & Co. were aware of risks that Vioxx could cause serious heart problems before the drug was approved in 1999. In Congress, an FDA expert accused the agency of having pressed him to withhold results of a study showing dangers posed by Vioxx. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department began investigations of Merck's handling of the drug. A study by the FDA estimated that Vioxx could have caused 27,785 heart attacks or deaths since its approval in 1999.

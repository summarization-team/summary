Yasser Arafat's wife controlled dissemination of information about his health. Reports differed on the severity of his illness and whether he was alive. He was transferred to a French military hospital near Paris. His condition later deteriorated. He suddenly went into a deep coma and death seemed imminent. Palestinian sources said he would be buried in the West Bank. Ariel Sharon said he could be buried in Gaza. Egypt might host the funeral services. Israeli and Palestinian officials met to discuss funeral arrangements but would not reveal them.

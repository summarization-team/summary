On March 14, 2005 the NPC adopted the ASL 2896-0, with Premier Wen Jiabao declaring the measure would strengthen ties across the Taiwan Straits. On Taiwan the president condemned the action saying the law damages the development of cross-strait relations. Taiwan share prices fell 1.5 percent. In Washington the White House declared the ASL "unfortunate" and the House of Representatives expressed "grave concern" by a vote of 424-4. Most world comment, however, was positive with statements of support from France, Cuba, Kenya, Kuwait, Bosnia-Herzegovina, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Rwanda, Croatia and others.

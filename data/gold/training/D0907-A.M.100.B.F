As deputy assistant attorney general with the Office of Legal Counsel in 2001, John C. Yoo wrote a secret memo concluding Bush had authority to wage preemptive war against terrorists and countries even if not linked to 9/11 attacks. In 2002 he wrote much of the memo saying the Geneva Convention did not apply to al-Qaida, a non-state terror organization. He said rules of war have changed because the enemy has changed. Our leaders can decide what system to apply. He denied that the White House influenced OLC advice. Yoo returned to teaching law at UC Berkeley after leaving government.

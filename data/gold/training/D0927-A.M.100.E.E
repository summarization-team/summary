ABC announced that "World News Tonight" anchor Peter Jennings has lung cancer. While making Jenning's condition public, the network did not provide details about the diagnosis or prognosis. Jennings, who quit smoking several years ago, will undergo chemotherapy in New York. He will continue to work on the newscast to the extent he can do so comfortably. Jennings wrote to his staff: "There will be good days and bad". Jennings had been a heavy smoker until the mid- to late 1980s. He returned to regular smoking after the terrorist attacks in 2001 but later quit again.

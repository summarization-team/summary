The Bush administration began an offensive in 2005 to persuade Congress to renew the Patriot Act, parts of which would expire in 2006. That law, passed after September 11, gave broad powers to government agencies to obtain information for fighting terrorism. They argued the Patriot Act has prevented further attacks. A coalition of conservatives and liberals organized to demand changes, believing the Act endangered individual freedom. The groups challenged provisions giving access to library, medical and firearm-ownership records; allowing secret searches; and allowing surveillance of protests. Earlier, a judge disallowed forcing Internet providers to turn over records.

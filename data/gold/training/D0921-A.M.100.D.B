Michael Jackson was arrested on Nov. 19, 2003 on ten counts including molestation of a 12-year-old boy and freed on $3million bail. Jackson pleaded not guilty. One of several searches of locations linked to Jackson seized the top layer of a mattress used in his mansion. A DNA swab from Jackson's mouth was taken the same day. Jury selection for his trial is scheduled for Jan. 31, 2005. During 2004 Jackson asked that the prosecutor be removed, led a protest against rapper Eminem, faced charges of non-payment of bills, and received an e-mail death threat.

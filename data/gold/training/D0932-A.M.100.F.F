San Francisco is considering charging grocery stores 17 cents per bag. Grocers could keep half and use it on approved programs. Grocers and the plastics industry are opposed. Public reaction is mixed. State legislators defeated a 2 cent charge last year. Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Eritrea ban plastic bags or charge a fee or fine for their use. In Ireland plastic bag use dropped 90 percent. Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda are planning or considering banning or taxing plastic bags. Rwanda urges traditional basket use. Shop owners object. Tanzania is establishing a recycling plant.

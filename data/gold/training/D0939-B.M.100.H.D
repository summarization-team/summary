The crash renewed concerns of engineers and safety experts that it is unsafe for locomotives to push rather than pull cars. The LA County DA expressed serious doubts about law enforcers' comments that Alvarez was deranged or insane and suggested he may have been trying to send a message to his estranged wife when he left his SUV on the tracks. Alvarez remained heavily sedated and under suicide watch. Prosecutors said he caused the crash to get his wife's attention and sympathy. Alvarez pled not guilty to murder and arson charges and prosecutors sought the death penalty against him.

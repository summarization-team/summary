John Yoo recommends the US develop new, ruthless and cunning ways to combat terrorist networks, some of which might run afoul of existing laws. In his new book, Yoo contends the US has the right to hold enemy combatants indefinitely without charges. He believes the constitution gives the president sole power to interpret international law. He believes cruel, inhumane or degrading interrogation techniques fall short of torture and should be employed at the president's discretion with prisoners overseas. Yoo wrote commentary on Supreme Court nominees John Roberts, Harriet Myers and Samuel Alito and on suggested government disaster response improvements.

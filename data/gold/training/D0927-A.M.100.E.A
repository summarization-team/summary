Peter Jennings's announcement April 5, 2005, that he had lung cancer left his colleagues at ABC News saddened and dismayed. He had been "World News Tonight" anchorman since 1983. By the end of the week, ABC had received 3,400 e-mails offering him prayers and good wishes. A former heavy smoker, Jennings had not been well for some time and was unable to travel abroad to cover foreign events. However, his diagnosis came as a surprise to him. ABC announced that Jennings would continue to anchor the news during chemotherapy treatment, but he was unable to do so.

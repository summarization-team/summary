On a Texas ranch on February 11, 2006, Vice President Cheney accidentally shot a hunting companion, Harry Whittington, 78. Whittington, peppered on the right side, received emergency care and then was flown to a Corpus Christi hospital. He was moved from the intensive care unit on February 13. Eyewitnesses said the shooting was Whittington's fault. Although the White House was notified within hours, the news was not made public until nearly 20 hours, when, with Cheney's permission, the ranch hostess alerted the local press. The timing and manner of notification drew sharp criticism from observers and the White House.

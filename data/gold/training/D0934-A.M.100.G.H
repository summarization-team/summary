Yasser Arafat's health declined in late October and he was flown to a military hospital outside Paris on Friday 29 October. On Wednesday 3 November he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Since then there have been conflicting reports about whether or not he has died. Funeral plans were under discussion and the 13 main Palestinian factions met on Tuesday to discuss arrangements. Egypt might host funeral services. France reached an agreement with Israel for Arafat to be buried at his headquarters in Ramallah. Israel refused to allow him to be buried in Jerusalem.

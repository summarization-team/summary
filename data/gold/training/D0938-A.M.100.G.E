The task of raising $500M for the World Trade Center memorial will fall to foundation made up of leaders from finance and real estate, cultural leaders, media celebrities and relatives of 9/11 victims. All four living ex-presidents of the US have agreed to become honorary directors of the project. The foundation is accepting all levels of gifts. Governor Pataki said financing of the memorial should be the top priority for allocating money from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's $816M grant. The WTC memorial named "Reflecting Absence" features two reflecting pools surround by gardens. It was chosen from 5201 entries.

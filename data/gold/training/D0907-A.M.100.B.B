John C. Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel 2001-2003. He drafted memos concerning the President's authority to wage preemptive war, the Geneva Convention, and torture. A Sept. 25, 2001 secret memo argued that President Bush had authority to wage preemptive war to protect the United Sates without Congressional approval. Other memos redefined torture and advised President Bush that the Geneva Convention does not apply to al-Qaida and the Taliban. Yoo is also a regular contributor to opinion pages of major newspapers.

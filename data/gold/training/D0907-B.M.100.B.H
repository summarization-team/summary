John Yoo defines torture as intense "pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death." He claims that "cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment" is something worse than torture. He thinks the U.S. should be more aggressive in fighting terrorism and find new ways to destroy networks, even assassinating leaders, setting up fake terrorist organizations and deceptive websites, and fabricating attacks on the U.S. He thinks that a judge should argue the facts of his case, not push for new theories and that courts should not make policy on important social issues.

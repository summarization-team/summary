Although Jennings indicated that he would return as anchor when able, he was never able. In a letter posted on April 29 he described how treatments had proven more debilitating than he had anticipated. About a month later he appeared at ABC News headquarters, his voice soft and his body as much as twenty pounds lighter than usual, and mentioned that he had started radiation treatment. Up until his final days, Jennings believed he could win his battle with lung cancer, but on Aug. 7, 2005 he died at his home in New York.

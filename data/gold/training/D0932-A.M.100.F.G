Governments around the world are taking steps to control the blight of plastic bags. Basic steps are collecting and recycling, education programs, clean-ups, and building recycling plants. Other nations are placing taxes or fees on the use of these bags. The "plastax" is common in Europe and decreased the use of plastic bags in Ireland by 90% in one year. California cities are investigating this tax. The strongest step is banning the importation, production, and distribution of these bags including enforcement and high fines. Producers and merchants are opposed to taxes and bans. The general population's reactions are mixed.

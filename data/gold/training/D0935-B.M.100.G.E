The Washington Nationals expect 45,000 for their home opener with President Bush throwing the first ceremonial pitch. More than 22,000 season tickets have been sold. Manager Frank Robinson saw the team win its opening home stand tied for first place. The team expects a pre-tax profit of $20M. Eight groups interested in ownership could bid up to $400M. Republicans oppose allowing a group that includes billionaire liberal George Soros to become owners of the Nationals. National's games have limited TV exposure due to legal battles resulting, in part, from the Orioles opposition to the move of the Expos to Washington.

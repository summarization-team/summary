Prosecutors changed tactics in the retrial of Kozlowski and Swartz from accusations of lavish spending used in the first trial, to a focus on charges that Kozlowski and Swartz had awarded themselves millions of dollars and concealed it from the board of Tyco. A retired board chairman testified he was never told about millions in forgiven loans and bonuses for the two executives. Tyco's former head of finance testified he never saw that millions of dollars in special bonuses were approved by a compensation committee. The VP of finance also said he wasn't aware of any documents to that effect.

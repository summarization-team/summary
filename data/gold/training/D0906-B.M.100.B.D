The Transportation Department hurried to clear major roads. Fire Department and California Highway Patrol employees worked round the clock. It was critical to reopen roads and highways so that people could get back to work. Caltrans estimated it spent $11 million for immediate repairs and would spend $40 million on roads and other public repairs. State officials and farm and insurance groups estimated damage to homes, roads, and farms at over $100 million.

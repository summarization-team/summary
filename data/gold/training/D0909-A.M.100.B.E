Irish PM Ahern said the main goal of the US-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998, a joint Catholic-Protestant administration in Northern Ireland, could be revived only with a complete end of IRA weapons use. The landmark peace deal led to a virtual end of violence in that area. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has appealed to IRA members to end their armed struggle in favor of democratic politics. Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will disarm. British PM Blair and Ahern will chair a review of the Northern Ireland situation in London.

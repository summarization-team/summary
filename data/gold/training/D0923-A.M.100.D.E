House Judiciary Committee Sensenbrenner attached his Real ID Act to a must-pass Iraq appropriations bill. The bill would make it more difficult for states to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and that it would protect against terrorist entry into the US. Civil libertarians oppose the bill on grounds that it would create a de facto national ID card. The measure may run counter to the president's support for a temporary guest worker program. States fear the act would add another unfunded federal mandate on them and create delays at motor vehicle bureaus. Immigrant rights groups oppose the Act.

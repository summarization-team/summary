Japanese envoy Akashi ended talks with the government and awaits meeting with LTTE leaders hoping to salvage the peace process. Japan is Sri Lanka's largest donor and supports the Norwegian-backed peace process. The peace process was officially blocked over differences on an agenda but diplomats say the split among Tamil Tigers could be the real reason. The Sri Lankan government and the LTTE held six rounds of direct negotiations between September 2002 and April 2003. Norwegian FM Petersen will visit Sri Lanka to try to revive stalled peace talks.

Harry Whittington, the Texas lawyer shot by Vice President Cheney, suffered a heart attack as a result of birdshot in his heart. One of the 100 shotgun pellets that wounded him moved into his heart and caused the attack. Doctors decided not to remove the pellet, saying they would treat his condition medically. The White House Press Secretary learned about the heart attack just before a press conference, but he did not mention it. The accident and heart attach caused a media frenzy. Some Cheney friends blamed Whittington, but five days later, Cheney spoke to the media, accepting full responsibility.

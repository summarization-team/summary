Three days before Sunday's election, 40 polling stations were already destroyed. Most were empty and casualties were low. Polling station attacks escalated Thursday through Saturday but no large-scale offensive materialized. Violence was concentrated in the Sunni heartland. Polling stations were attacked with homemade bombs, car bombs, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, and small arms fire. Two police guards were shot dead. The worst attacks were a car bomb in Samarra that hit a nearby Iraqi army patrol, killing seven; and a Zarqawi-connected suicide bomber who approached a Khanaqin polling station and set off a blast that killed eight, including three soldiers.

Introduction of the "morning-after pill" led to much controversy over its use and distribution. Some groups considered it a form of abortion while others argued it was not. Some said it encouraged teen-age sex while scientific studies indicated it did not. The pill was available by prescription only. Proponents argued for its sale "over the counter" (OTC). Opponents said this would encourage teen-age sex. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected a proposal for OTC sales in May 2004. In January 2005 it continued to consider OTC sales to women 16 years or older.

The Real ID Act restricts asylum, bans drivers' licenses for illegal aliens and allows for construction of a wall along the Mexican border near San Diego which may cause harm to the Tijuana estuary. Vicente Fox has condemned the measure. An editorial claims that denying licenses to undocumented workers will result in fewer licensed and insured drivers and thus less safety. Real ID has some requirements that would necessitate extensive and costly changes to systems used by some states. California is considering a license valid only for driving and not as id for other purposes.

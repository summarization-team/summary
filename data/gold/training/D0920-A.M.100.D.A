Yusuf Islam, formerly known as the singer, Cat Stevens, was deported from the United States in 2004, suspected of having terrorist links. Islam sold 50 million records in the 60s and 70s. He converted to Islam in the late 70s, abandoning his career and devoting himself to philanthropy. Later, learning the Koran does not ban music, he traveled to the U.S to cut a record. Making a follow-up trip, he was detained. Time Magazine reported Islam's deportation was caused by a spelling mixup over his name. In November, 2004, Islam was awarded a peace prize by the Gorbachev Foundation.

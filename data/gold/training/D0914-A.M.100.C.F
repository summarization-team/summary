In October 2004, three terrorist car bombs shook Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular with vacationing Israelis, killing 35 (including 23 Israelis) and wounding 125. A powerful car bomb close to the entrance of the Taba Hilton destroyed much of the hotel. Two hours later two vans exploded at tourist camps in Ras Satan (Ras al-Sultan) and Nueiba. Seven died at Ras al-Sultan, mostly Egyptian workers. The previously unknown World Islamist Group claimed responsibility. The attack occurred Thursday night at the close of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, amid an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip that left 93 Palestinians dead.

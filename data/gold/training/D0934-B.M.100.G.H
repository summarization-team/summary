Arafat lay in a coma at the hospital for a week and died at 0230 GMT on Thursday 10 November. No cause of death was given. The Palestinian Authority declared a 40-day period of mourning with private businesses closed for three days, public institutions for seven. Arafat's body was to be flown to Cairo for a funeral Friday to be attended by Arab and international leaders. Then his body was to be flown to Ramallah for burial in the presidential compound. Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip and tightened security "to allow a dignified funeral ceremony."

On March 1, 2005, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the death penalty for murderers who were under age 18 at the time of their crime is unconstitutional. Justice Anthony Kennedy said in the majority opinion that because juveniles still struggle to define their identities it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime is evidence of irretrievably depraved character. He noted that the US was the last remaining nation to abolish the death penalty for minors. His comment reignited debate over the court's consideration of foreign laws and opinions when interpreting the Constitution.

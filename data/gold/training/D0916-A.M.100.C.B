U.S. journalist Jill Carroll, in Baghdad for The Christian Science Monitor (CSM), was kidnapped on Jan. 9, 2006 by gunmen who killed her interpreter. The CSM and Reporters Without Borders pleaded for her release. The U.S. forces, acting on a tip, raided a mosque causing strong protests but no positive results. On Jan. 17 an Arab television network ran a video showing Carroll as her captors threatened to kill her unless the U. S. released all female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours. The network demanded and Carroll's family made an emotional appeal for her release.

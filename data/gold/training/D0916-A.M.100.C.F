Journalist Jill Carroll was kidnapped in western Baghdad Saturday morning, January 7th. Her car was ambushed as she traveled to interview Sunni politician Adnan al-Dulaimi, who denied any appointment with Carroll. Gunmen pulled Carroll's driver from the car and drove off with Carroll and her Iraqi interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, all in 15 seconds. The interpreter was found dead. A video showing Carroll aired Tuesday. "Brigades of Vengeance" threatened to kill her unless the US freed female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours. The press and Carroll's family appealed for her release. US forces raided Umm al-Qura mosque, following a tip.

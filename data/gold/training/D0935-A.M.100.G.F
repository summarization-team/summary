Major League Baseball owners conditionally approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos, to be called the Nationals, to Washington DC in 2005. No owner was in place. Mayor Anthony Williams pledged that DC would build a new ballpark. The first three seasons the team would play at RFK Stadium. City Council chairman Linda Cropp insisted half the construction cost be paid for privately but a compromise was reached. The Cleveland-based Gates Group offered $100 million in return for parking revenues. Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos claimed a monopoly on regional baseball broadcasting. Public resentment grew concerning the high stadium cost.

By Aug. 13 Sheehan's group of about a half-dozen activists had grown to about 300 including reporters and confronted by about 100 Bush supporters. The drainage-ditch roadside encampment, dubbed Camp Casey after Sheehan's son, was crowded and caused traffic congestion. On August 16 Sheehan announced that a neighbor had offered a spacious field about one mile from Bush's ranch to accommodate Camp Casey. Sheehan promised to remain encamped there throughout Bush's 5-weeek stay and to return whenever he does. She also announced a series of 1,000 candlelight vigils nationwide on Aug. 17.

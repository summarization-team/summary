John Yoo, a conservative Justice Department lawyer in the Bush Administration, helped write a series of legal memos stating that there were no limits on the President's power to wage war and redefining torture, saying that the Geneva Convention does not apply to the treatment of terrorists. Yoo asserted that these tightly held memos would not convert to orders for soldiers to violate human rights. He insisted that the White House had not dictated or influenced the content of the memos. He believed that interrogation methods should not be disclosed because terrorists could then train people to resist such methods.

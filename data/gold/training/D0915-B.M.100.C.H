Six people died in the Sunday January 30 Iraqi elections, despite heavy Iraqi security around polling places. Many Iraqis defied the insurgents' threats of attacks in order to vote; however, there was little or no turn-out in Fallujah and Samarra because of the security situation. The most serious attacks were in Baghdad, where five people including a policeman were killed, along with the suicide bomber, and in Balad, where a woman was killed. There were also attacks in Basra and Mosul but no casualties were reported.

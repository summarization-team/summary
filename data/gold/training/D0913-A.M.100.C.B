On March 2, 2005 the Supreme Court faced the issue of whether display of the Ten Commandments (T.C.) at government buildings violates the principle of separation of church and state. Two cases from Texas and Kentucky raised several questions. Are the T.C. a religious statement, a part of legal history, or both? If courts and legislatures can call for God's help in invocations, what's wrong with displaying the T.C.? Does the appearance of the T.C. among other statuary constitute an endorsement? From justices' questions and remarks a split decision seemed likely.

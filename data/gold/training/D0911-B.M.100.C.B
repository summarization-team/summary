On March 22 the Japanese justice minister said it was legally possible to send Fischer to Iceland if he obtained citizenship. Fischer's lawyer expected him to be released within the week. Citizenship still required the signature of Iceland's president. The U.S. State Department expressed disappointment over Iceland's parliamentary action. As of March 23 U.S. officials were preparing tax-evasion charges against Fischer which might render him extraditable from Iceland. The same day (Wednesday) Iceland's ambassador to Japan said Iceland had forwarded documents to Japan confirming Fischer's Icelandic citizenship and hoped to give Fischer a passport before the weekend.

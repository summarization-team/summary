Progress continues to be made in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir despite the April killing by suspected Muslim rebels of six Indians, including three policemen. The Pakistani President visited India in April for his first formal talks with the Indian Prime Minister. In June eight moderate separatist leaders from India visited Pakistan. In September the Indian Prime Minister invited separatists for peace talks. On the economic front, India and Pakistan were scheduled to hold joint economic meetings for the first time in 16 years. They are focusing on banking, air and shipping services, customs rules, and regular bus service.

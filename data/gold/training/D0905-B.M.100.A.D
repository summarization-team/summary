Advocates say a Nantucket wind farm could produce three fourths of electricity needs for the Cape Cod area. Wind farms can reduce reliance on fossil fuel, global warming, and, pollution. It could bring jobs, fish and perhaps a tourist attraction. Opponents argue that Nantucket is the wrong place for a farm. The plan relies on unproved technology. A large wind turbine project is planned in Taiwan. A proposed wind farm overlooking Ireland's oldest religious site was ruled out for fear it would disrupt the sanctuary's tranquility.

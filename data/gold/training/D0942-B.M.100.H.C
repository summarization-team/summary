On March 13, China announced its adoption of the Anti-Secession Law. Taiwan condemned Beijing for passing the law, saying it caused irreparable damage to cross-strait relations. Taiwan officials said that the ROC is an independent sovereign state belonging to the Taiwan people. Any move to change the status quo without the people's approval is unacceptable. Taiwan share prices dropped sharply. The US expressed concern and called China's adoption of the law unfortunate. China announced that more countries supported its adoption of the law than not and listed numerous tiny countries, mostly in Africa and Asia, and France.

Carroll was kidnapped in one of Baghdad's most dangerous neighborhoods. The main Sunni Arab party and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called for Carroll's release. CAIR would send representatives to Baghdad to seek her release. It would make a public appeal to the kidnappers Thursday in Amman and Friday in Baghdad. The kidnapping of journalists was condemned. New images were aired Thursday showing Carroll surrounded by masked gunmen. Six of eight Iraqi women detainees were to be freed within days following a review of their cases, but Iraqi and US officials denied a link with kidnappers' demands.

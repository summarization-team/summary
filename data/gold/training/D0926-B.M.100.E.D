On Wednesday after nearly 29 flight hours Steve Fossett reached his halfway point over India. While relying on autopilot, he could not ignore the complex demands of the aircraft for more than 10-20 minutes at a time. On Wednesday, while flying over mainland China mission control officials reported his fuel was 450 gallons less than expected. Fossett decided to fly to Hawaii to re-evaluate the situation. There he decided to proceed. The jet stream and great tailwinds over the Pacific allowed him to make up time. Fossett made a perfect landing in Salina Kansas after a 67-hour flight.

ABC announced on April 5, 2005 that its anchor on "World News Tonight," Peter Jennings, has lung cancer. Jennings, who began chemotherapy the following week, had earlier missed overseas assignments, but was thought to be battling flu. Specialists suggested that the cancer is in an advanced stage. By the end of the week ABC had received more than 3,400 e-mails offering Jennings prayers and good wishes. On April 29 a statement from Jennings was read on "World News Tonight" thanking his good wishers who he said "have spoiled me rotten".

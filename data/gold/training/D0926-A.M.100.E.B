Steve Fossett's attempt at the first around-the-world non-stop no-refueling solo flight began with takeoff of the Global Flyer from Salina (Kansas) Municipal Airport at 0047GMT on March 1, 2005. Fossett described takeoff as "difficult" as the aircraft was slower than he had expected. By 0400GMT he was over Canada where he experienced a GPS malfunction, but after a couple of hours it reengaged. At 1607GMT he was over Morocco and by 0330GMT March 2nd the Global Flyer was over the Arabian Sea heading east towards Karachi, Pakistan at about 390mph.

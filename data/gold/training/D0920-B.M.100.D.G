In early 2005, Yusuf Islam devoted his time to helping Indonesian victims of the tsunami. He planned to give a concert, release a record, and donate money from two British newspapers. The papers paid unspecified damages for October articles suggesting he had ties to terrorism. In September, Islam spoke at the opening of an Islamic study center at Cardiff University. There he placed some blame for the July 7 bombings on foreign policy, but also called on Muslim schools to keep students from extremist ideas. In 1995, his school in London became the first Islamic school to win public funding.

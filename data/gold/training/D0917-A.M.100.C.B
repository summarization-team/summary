The process for electing a pope is governed by centuries-old rules with some modernization introduced in 1996. New rules on voting provided that the required 2/3 majority of cardinals would revert to a single majority if no decision had been reached after several days. On the morning of April 18, 2005, Cardinal Ratzinger, a prominent contender for pope, delivered a homily strongly endorsing orthodoxy. That afternoon, after the first voting session, a signal of white smoke from The Sistine Chapel roof, which would indicate election of a pope, turned to black, showing that no decision had been made.

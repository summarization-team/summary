Anti-Patriot Act resolutions were adopted in five states and 375 communities. While Congress debated making Patriot Act provisions permanent, there was strong bipartisan support for retaining the "sunset" provisions to ensure Justice Department accountability. Critics of the Patriot Act sought changes to limit the Act in several ways, including informing suspects of "sneak and peek" searches within 7 days unless a judge intervened. The Senate Intelligence Committee met behind closed doors to consider a draft bill that would escalate government police powers. The bill was viewed as a Republican maneuver to shift arguments to expanding the Patriot Act.

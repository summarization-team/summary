Proponents of wind power assert that it is a safe, non-polluting, renewable alternative to fossil fuel. Opponents say that the turbines are ugly, disrupt fishing, harm birds and marine wildlife, and affect local weather. Wind power is widely used in Europe, both on land and offshore. Now the first U.S. off-shore wind farm has been proposed for Nantucket Sound. Opponents emphasize the aesthetic impact of the project, while a draft environmental report said that it would not hinder commercial or sport activities nor would it kill birds or fish or affect currents, water quality, or noise levels.

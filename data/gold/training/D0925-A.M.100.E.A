In June 2005, Steve Jobs announced that Apple would switch to Intel chips for some of its Macintosh computers in 2006, all by 2007. IBM, its supplier for 14 years, was unable to deliver its new PC chip that promised more power and less heat, both needed for laptops Apple planned. The move was a gamble for Apple because software developers would have to re-engineer all programs for Intel chips. Intel celebrated the deal, although Macintosh held only 2% of the market. IBM was not badly hurt; it had long planned to concentrate on chips for computer games.

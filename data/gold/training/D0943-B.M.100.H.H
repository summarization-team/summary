On 16 March, the judge acquitted the two Canadian Sikhs charged in the Air India bombings. Saying that the prosecution's major witnesses were not credible, the British Columbia Supreme Court Justice stated that the prosecution had failed to prove the men guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but added that he was certain both bombs had originated on flights out of Vancouver. He had heard the case without a jury at the defendants' request. The two Sikhs were released immediately. The verdict shocked everyone. Many people sharply criticized the police and secret services and demanded a government investigation.

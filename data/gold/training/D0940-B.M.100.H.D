Some 16,000 people attended the Disneyland opening. The park employed 5000 people and was predicted to draw 5.6 million people the first year. Two weeks after opening Disneyland activists were concerned about the harsh working conditions. Disney officials discouraged unionizing. The HKSAR government defended the park against the labor conditions, saying Disney needed time to learn the local culture. Two months after the park opened, Disneyland lowered the ticket price, denying it was related to low attendance, and refused to discuss attendance. The HKSAR government argued they should reveal attendance numbers to them because they were the largest Disneyland investor.

On Jan. 18, 2005 the Iraqi justice ministry announced that six Iraqi female detainees are to be released soon. U.S. forces had earlier said they were holding a total of eight Iraqi women and on Jan. 19 stated that some may be released "in accordance with the normal process," but both U.S. and Iraqi spokesmen denied reacting to the kidnappers' threats. Sen. John Kerry announced that he had discussions with Iraqi President Talabani on Carroll's fate and her mother read an appeal on CNN for her daughter's release as the 72-hour deadline approached.

In the 13th century cardinals spent more time hunting and feasting than seriously deliberating, so in 1271 a mob tore the roof off their meeting place, exposing them to the elements, and gave them only bread and water to force a decision. Now cardinals are locked up until they decide. Previously, conclaves were held in the town where the last pope died. Smoke became the logical means of signaling a decision because ballots needed to be burned. After John Paul II's death the Vatican stipulated that special chemicals be added to the smoke and bells be rung to avoid confusion.

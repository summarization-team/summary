Chess legend Bobby Fischer has been held in detention in Japan for eight months after trying to leave Tokyo on a revoked US passport. He faces deportation and prison in the US for violating sanctions on the former Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992. Supporters worked to secure his passage to Iceland, where he is revered as a national hero for beating Boris Spassky there in 1972. Iceland's parliament granted Fischer a foreigner's passport and a residency permit. But, that was not enough. After receiving assurance that Icelandic citizenship would enable Japan to free Fischer, parliament granted it to him.

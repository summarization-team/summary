Iceland's granting of citizenship to Bobby Fischer, formally signed into law on March 22, made it legally possible for Japan to deport him to that country. Japanese law only permits deportation to a country where a person is a citizen. Fischer's Icelandic passport was expected to be ready on March 23. Japanese officials agreed to allow him to travel to Iceland after he withdraws his pending lawsuit against the Japanese government to block his deportation. A Fischer supporter said he would do so on the morning of March 24 on his way to the airport to fly to Iceland.

Jury selection for Michael Jackson's expected six-month trial began on January 31. Jackson could face 20 years in prison. On February 15, Jackson was hospitalized for 33 hours suffering from the flu, delaying jury selection. By February 23, jury selection was completed. Opening arguments were delivered on February 28. Jackson was accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy at his Neverland Ranch between February 3 and March 3, 2003. The prosecution alleged Jackson plotted to kidnap the boy and his family and hold them in order to limit the damage caused by the 2003 documentary that inspired the charges against him.

In eco-friendly nations, such as Germany and Denmark, wind energy has largely replaced traditional coal, gas, oil and nuclear for power generation. There, wind-powered energy is increasing 15 to 30 percent per year. Big investments in wind power are also being made in Brazil, France, mainland China, Spain, Sweden and Turkey. In 2001, Texas set a U.S. record by installing more wind power capacity than any other state. But recently, 15 states have surpassed Texas's record. New York, California and Hawaii have enacted legislation requiring that 20% of energy companies' output must come from renewable sources by 2020.

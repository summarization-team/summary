Peter Jennings, a Canadian-born high school dropout, who became the face of ABC News and a household name in the United States, died in August 2005. He was 67. ABC News stated, "Peter died with his family around him, without pain and in peace." A friend said Jennings had faced lung cancer "with realism, courage, and a firm hope that he would be one of the fortunate ones." In the end, he was not. Jennings' death brought to an end a decades-long era in television news dominated by three figures, CBS's Dan Rather, NBC'S Tom Brokaw and ABC's Jennings.

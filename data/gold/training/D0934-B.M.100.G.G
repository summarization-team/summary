Palestinians announced that upon his death the body would be flown to Egypt for a funeral service, then to the West Bank town of Ramallah, for burial at al Muqata'a, his former headquarters. In the afternoon, space for the grave was being cleared. Arafat died at 0230 GMT on November 11. He reportedly had suffered liver and kidney failure. The Palestinians announced a 40-day mourning period, with government offices closed for 7 days and businesses closed for 3 days. Israel sealed the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

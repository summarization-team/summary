Germany is the world's leading solar energy market. Farmers are replacing crops with fields of solar energy panels, thanks to government incentives, which have spurred 150 percent growth in one year. A world leader in renewal energy a decade ago, the U.S. is lagging. For lack of government support, its share of photovoltaic cell production has dropped from 45 percent in 1996 to 8 percent in 2005. The U.S. may gain ground by use of technology. One producer predicts that, thanks to technical improvement, the cost of solar systems will drop by two-thirds over the next five years.

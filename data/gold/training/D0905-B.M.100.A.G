Wind power proponents believe the technology will become competitive as the cost of fossil fuel rises and larger turbines are brought online. Turbines are touted for their low noise and the lack of exhaust gas or water. Two negatives with wind power are its dependence on the changeable weather and the distances of farms from population centers. Opposition to wind power becomes more ferocious when planned farms are believed to infringe on the vistas of the wealthy and political influential or on historical, religious sites.

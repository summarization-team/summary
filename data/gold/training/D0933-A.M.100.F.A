Swedish researchers discovered that children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia. The risk increases with the age of the father. Unfortunately, trends in developed countries are toward delaying parenthood. Several studies have found that, at least in teenagers, heavy cannabis use can be a contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia. Australian researchers have found a link between the impaired thought processes in schizophrenia and thinning grey matter in the brain. Schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component, but changes in the epigenome, natural chemical modifications of genes, after birth, may hold a clue to its non-genetic aspects.

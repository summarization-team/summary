Spring and early summer brought more controversies to the WCT Memorial. A new Foundation CEO was named. One last parcel of land still was needed. Various interest groups were battling over aspects of the ground zero area including the International Freedom Center, the Drawing Center, the Performing arts center, and the Freedom Tower office building. The families of victims were fighting commercial interests. The Foundation's money drive is falling short, but the governor has promised some public funds. Elements of the original design are continually being altered. Two spot-gap memorial projects were begun in June and July.

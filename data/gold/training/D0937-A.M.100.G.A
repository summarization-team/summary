Vice President Dick Cheney did not have a valid hunting license when he shot Harry Whittington in February 2006. This added to the uproar caused by the shooting and by Cheney's staff delaying a report of the incident for 20 hours. Cheney accidentally sprayed Whittington with bird shot in the face, neck and chest while they hunted on a ranch in south Texas. Whittington, 78, a prominent lawyer, was treated on the scene by Cheney's medical detail before being taken by helicopter to a Corpus Christi hospital. He was in stable condition the next day. Cheney was apologetic.

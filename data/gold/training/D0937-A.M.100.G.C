Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a hunting partner on February 11 during a weekend quail hunting trip in Texas. Cheney's friend, attorney Harry Whittington from Austin, was sprayed in the face, neck, and chest with birdshot. Whittington was reported to be in stable condition in a Corpus Christi hospital. The incident was first reported by the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. Cheney's office disclosed the accident 20 hours after it occurred. White House staff was criticized for the delay. The incident provided a wealth of material for Democrats, gun control activists and late night comedians.

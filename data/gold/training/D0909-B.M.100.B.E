IRA has reportedly renounced its armed struggle for a united Ireland. The disposal of IRA arms remains unclear. Adams did confirm that the Roman Catholic paramilitary group was on the verge of making a significant statement. Ahern remained cautious and Northern Ireland Protestant leader Ian Paisley requires absolute proof. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan hailed the decision and Blair called the statement very positive. The IRA pledge to lay down its arms and adopt peaceful means to end British rule in Northern Ireland took effect at 4:00 PM on July 28.

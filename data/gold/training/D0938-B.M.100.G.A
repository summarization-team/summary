In May, 2005, Governor Pataki announced he would earmark $300 million to jumpstart fund-raising for the September 11 memorial. He also planned to push ahead the timetable for redesign of the Freedom Tower office building. By doing so Pataki admitted the effort to build the memorial had suffered serious setbacks. Families of the victims criticized the design, including the cultural building: Too large; the streetwalls; too high. They objected to changes: Two pedestrian ramps instead of four. The original design was being whittled away. Goldman Sachs suspended plans to build a $2 billion 40-story headquarters at the site.

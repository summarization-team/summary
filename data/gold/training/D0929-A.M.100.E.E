An evacuation order was issued Monday for the Florida keys as Tropical Storm Rita approached and is likely to be upgraded to a level one hurricane. Rita brushed past Key West Tuesday and was forecast to strengthen to a major hurricane, possibly a category 4, later in the week. Once again, New Orleans implemented emergency services and some individuals were evacuated. Hurricane Katrina survivors taking refuge in Texas were being uprooted again as Rita threatened. Texas now bears the greatest threat from Rita. The Texas coastal county of Galveston will order a mandatory evacuation on Wednesday in preparation of Rita.

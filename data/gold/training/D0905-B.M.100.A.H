Advocates for the Nantucket Sound off-shore wind farm maintain that the farm would bring jobs to the area, that it might be a tourist attraction, and that the towers would attract fish. Opponents say that it relies on unproven technology and that this is the wrong location. A German group building a project in Taiwan claims that it will cause no pollution, low noise, and no exhaust gas or waste water - it is clean, competitive, and inexhaustible. In Ireland a project near a very old pilgrimage site was abandoned because it would "interfere with its tranquility."

The European-built Huygens space probe landed safely on Titan's surface as scheduled on January 14. Mission controllers were confident it landed on a solid, soft surface. It continued to send back pictures and data after the landing, and would continue to do so until its batteries ran out. The initial black and white images of Titan's surface sent by Huygens before noon EST astonished scientists. The scientific feat, 25 years in the making, represents the farthest from Earth that a spacecraft has landed. It also is the first landing of a spacecraft on the moon of another planet.

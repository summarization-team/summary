Witnesses saw Alvarez douse his SUV with gasoline, position it across the tracks and walk away. Train 100's lead car pushed the SUV down the track, derailed, turned on its side and slid into a freight car, toppling it. As Train 901 passed, the jackknifed Train 100 cars derailed 901's rear two cars. Alvarez was trying to create a spectacle to win back his estranged wife, not commit suicide. He slashed his arms and chest superficially with scissors. Alvarez pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and arson with special circumstances (train wrecking). Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

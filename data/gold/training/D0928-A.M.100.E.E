Former Tyco executive Dennis Kozlowski has been charged in a tax case with conspiracy, falsifying business records and tampering with evidence. He is accused of scheming with dealers to avoid paying over $1M tax on $13M of artworks. He and another Tyco executive, Mark Swartz, are also accused in a larceny case of looting over $600M from the company by illegally awarding themselves bonuses and concealing them from shareholders. A trial of the two ended in a hung jury. They are to be retried in New York. The judge refused separate trials.

The Huygens probe is "a fantastic success for Europe." During the 2-1/2-hour descent through Titan's atmosphere, it filmed Titan's surface, measured wind speed and pressure, and analyzed the atmosphere. The first pictures, taken from a height of about 10 miles as Huygens descended, showed a strange, rugged terrain with drainage channels for liquids. The probe landed safely on the surface at about 1234 GMT on 14 January and the sensors, which were expected to work for only three minutes after landing, continued to function for at least 30 minutes.

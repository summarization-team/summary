The massive explosion at Taba killed at least 30 and injured more than 100 in a terrorist attack aimed at Israeli tourists. Israel blamed al-Qaida but a group called "Islamic Unity Brigades" claimed responsibility. Israeli officials speculated that the militants were finding it difficult to attack Israelis in Israel and were choosing to attack them abroad. The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry. Two blasts in quick succession had collapsed a ten story wing of the luxury Taba Hilton hotel. More than 100 rescue workers were allowed to enter the damaged area.

The Supreme Court made two separate 5-4 decisions regarding displays of the Ten Commandments, leaving the issue to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Justice Breyer cast the critical swing vote in both cases. The Court ruled that the Texas display was constitutional because it was one of 17 monuments, it had historical as well as religious significance, and it had been there for over 40 years without challenge. In contrast, in Kentucky the Commandments were initially displayed alone; the accompanying historical documents were added in response to a lawsuit, seemingly to hide a religious motivation.

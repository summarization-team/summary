In Roper v. Simmons the Supreme Court heard arguments challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty for criminals under 18. The defense argued that minors were not fully developed intellectually or morally and that therefore such executions violate the constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. It asserted that a national consensus had emerged on that subject and pointed out that the U.S. is the only country in the world that allows the execution of juveniles. Prosecutors contended that Simmons was old enough to know right from wrong and challenged the notion that a national consensus had emerged.

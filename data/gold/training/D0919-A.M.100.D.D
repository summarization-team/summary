Prince Charles announced unexpectedly that he would marry Camilla Parker Bowles in April at Windsor Castle. The British Prime minister, Archbishop of Canterbury, Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Charles' sons were pleased over the engagement. Brits reacted more with relief than happiness, viewing it as a logical conclusion to a difficult situation. Camilla will receive the title HRH the duchess of Cornwall. If Charles ascends to the thrown she will become HRH the princess consort. The wedding, a civil service for family and friends, will be followed by a prayer and dedication service. The couple will honeymoon in Scotland.

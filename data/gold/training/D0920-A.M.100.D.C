British singer Yusuf Islam was formerly known as the popular singer-songwriter Cat Stevens before converting to Islam 30 years ago. He has established Islamic schools in Britain and worked as a peace activist. Recently, he sang at a charity concert in London and recorded a version of one of his hits. He is writing a Broadway musical based on his hits. The Gorbachev Foundation awarded Islam its Man of Peace prize in November. In September, Islam was barred from entering the US when his name appeared on a no-fly list because of possible terrorist links. Islam denies any terrorist connection.

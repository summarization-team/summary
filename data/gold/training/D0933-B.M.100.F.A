Studies of famines years ago in Holland and China revealed that children born of severely malnourished mothers were twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as others. Scientists knew that vitamin A plays an important role in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; now they've discovered it acts upon a gene that influences neuron activity. Damage to the enzyme PDE4B increases the risk of developing mental illness, and researchers have discovered that the gene DISC1 acts as a regulator for PDE4B. Some scientists believe that lack of insulin in the brain may cause schizophrenia, but they reject "insulin shock therapy," popular mid-20th century.

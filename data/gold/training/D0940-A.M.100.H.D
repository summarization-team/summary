The Hong Kong Disneyland was built by Walt Disney Company and the HKSA government in 2005 in three phases to ensure a smooth start. Disney consulted Chinese feng shui before building Disneyland and its influences were incorporated into the park's physical orientation, opening date, and local cultural considerations. Disneyland staged its rehearsal period for four weeks before opening for employee performance practice. While ticket sales were initially good, they were disappointing. The HKSAR government funded the bulk of the park and was positive about it initially. After a while they questioned whether it was a reasonable deal for them.

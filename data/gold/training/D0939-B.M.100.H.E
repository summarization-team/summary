Prosecutors added arson to the 11 counts of murder with special circumstances against Alvarez after it was determined that he had poured gasoline on his vehicle. The district attorney has contradicted the police and has suggested that his act was calculated and not a suicidal or insane act. A Glendale policeman said that Alvarez planned to create a "spectacular" scene to gain his wife's sympathy. Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to all counts and is being held without bail. His lawyer maintains he was despondent over his marriage break-up and planned to kill himself but not others.

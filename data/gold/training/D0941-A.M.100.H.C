After a seven-year journey, the Huygens space probe successfully separated from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn at about 10:24 p.m. EST December 24, beginning its three-week, 2 million-mile free fall toward Saturn's moon Titan. It will remain dormant until January 14, when it will float to the moon's surface on parachutes, shooting pictures and sending back data for about 2.5 hours before hitting the surface. Scientists hope Huygens will confirm the assumption that Titan's atmosphere is similar to that of early Earth. The mission is a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.

The FDA was supposed to make a decision on the revised OTC proposal in January 2005, but it did not. In February the acting FDA Commissioner was nominated to be Commissioner. He declared the subject of the pill "complex" and could not say when a decision would be made. Some senators refused to vote for confirmation until a decision was announced. As the FDA stalled, debate continued and states began to debate local action and such peripheral issues as whether pharmacists are compelled to sell products to which they have moral objections.

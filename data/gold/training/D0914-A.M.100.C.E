Three explosions shook Egyptian resorts popular with vacationing Israelis. At least 35 people were killed and 100 wounded. Initially reported as a gas leak, the largest explosion may have been a truck bomb driven into the Taba Hilton across the border from the Israeli resort town of Eilat. Two other explosions took place to the southwest at Ras al-Sultan and Nuweiba. At least seven died at the former, most Egyptian workers. A previously unknown group, Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya claimed responsibility for the Taba Hilton bombing. Shin Bet intelligence service had advised Israelis not to go Sinai resorts during holidays.

Two men accused of bombing an Air India jet, killing 329 people in 1985, were tried in Vancouver nearly 20 years later. Prosecutors charged that a millionaire named Malik and a millworker named Bagri were Sikhs taking revenge against the Indian government, which owned Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984. The prosecution's case rested upon their providing financial assistance to a man convicted in the case, attempting to interfere with investigations, and admissions to people they trusted. Defense lawyers attacked the credibility of witnesses. There were years of bungled police work and unexplained killings of witnesses.

Michael Jackson is having a rough time. His long-time attorney Steve Cochran left the defense team for unknown reasons. Eminem made a music video showing a Jackson look-alike in bed with children. He has been sued for three million dollars by a former business associate for breach of contract and for $180,000 by an antique store for unpaid bills. And a Canadian pleaded guilty to emailing a death threat to Jackson. Another search was made of Jackson's Neverland Ranch on 3 December and the following day investigators took DNA samples from Jackson's mouth.

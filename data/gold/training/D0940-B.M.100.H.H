Hong Kong Disneyland opened as scheduled on 12 September. Over 80% of the visitors in the first month rated their experience as very good or excellent. The park drew fewer visitors than expected in its first two months, despite offering a discount for HK residents. Disneyland steadfastly refused to disclose attendance figures - a move that angered lawmakers since the government owns a 57% stake the park. In late November Disney said that there had been "well over" one million guests. Workers complained about long hours, short turnarounds, and lack of breaks.

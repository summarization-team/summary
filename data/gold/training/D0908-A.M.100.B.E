The US faced a policy challenge resulting from the unexpected action of Nepal's King Gyanendra in dissolving the government and claiming absolute power. The king claimed it was necessary to restore peace and democracy in the face of Maoist insurgency. The US, Britain and India who provide aid to Nepal have widely condemned the king's action. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed deep concern and the European Union joined the international condemnation of Gyanendra's action. Japan, another aid donor to Nepal, voiced concern at the power grab. China called the action "an internal affair" and Pakistan adopted the same approach.

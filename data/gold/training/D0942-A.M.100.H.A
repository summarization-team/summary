In early 2005, a Taiwanese official said Beijing's plan to pass an anti-secession law was aimed at legalizing a mainland invasion of his country. It would undermine stabililty across the Taiwan Strait, according to Taiwan's President Chen. Taiwan sent six delegations to the U.S., Japan and EU countries the year before to brief officials on the adverse impact on cross-strait relations the law would have. Beijing said in March, that "one country, two systems" was its basic approach to Taiwan, outlining, for the first time, its anti-secession law that was being considered by the National People's Congress.

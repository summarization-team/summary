There appears to be progress in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir. The bilateral ceasefire has held for a year. The Indian Prime Minister met with Kashmiri political leaders for the first time. India has reduced the number of border troops and announced a multibillion-dollar development plan. Bus service has been opened for the first time in 57 years. The Pakistani President has suggested three solutions: Some areas of Kashmir could be made independent or placed under joint Indian-Pakistani control or put under UN administration. However, India has ruled out division along religious lines or redrawing international borders.

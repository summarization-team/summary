The Washington Nationals enjoyed a very successful beginning to the baseball season. By June, the team was on pace to earn a $22 million profit. The residents were excited, merchandise sales were in the top five, the Nationals outdrew the Orioles, and attendance was the ninth highest. The wily manager and his no-name players led the National League on June 26, despite the low payroll and nonexistent farm system. Significant issues, however, remain; the team has still not been sold, games are not on local cable, and sharing the dated stadium with a major league soccer team creates problems.

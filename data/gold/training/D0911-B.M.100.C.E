Japan may allow Fischer to go to Iceland where he now holds citizenship if he withdraws a lawsuit against the government to block his deportation. His Icelandic citizenship still requires the president's signature but that appears assured. Fischer has been in Japanese prison for six months including time in solitary for a tussle with guards. Fischer renounced US citizenship but not through proper process so he remains a US citizen said the State Department. He is a fugitive from justice and there is federal warrant for his arrest. His alleged violation of US sanctions is not considered extraditable by Japan.

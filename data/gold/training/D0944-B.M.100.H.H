In Roper v. Simmons the Supreme Court ruled 5-to-4 that executing 16- and 17-year-olds violated the Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The decision noted that the brains of adolescents function differently from those of adults and observed that American society believes that adulthood begins at 18 in regard to voting, serving on a jury, or marrying without parental consent. It also stated that the "national consensus" on capital punishment had changed and that the U.S. was the only country that allowed the execution of minors, thus confirming the importance of international opinion.

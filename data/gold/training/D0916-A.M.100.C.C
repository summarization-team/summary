On January 7, Jill Carroll, a Christian Science Monitor journalist, was kidnapped in Baghdad by gunmen who killed her Iraqi interpreter. Iraqi and US investigators have been hunting for her. Acting on a tip, Iraqi and US soldiers raided a Baghdad mosque in the early morning of January 10. Six people were detained. On January 17, the Arab television network Al-Jazeera ran a video of Carroll with an accompanying message that she would be killed unless the US freed all female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours. The kidnappers identified themselves as the Brigades of Vengeance, a previously unknown group.

Efforts to revive talks between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tiger rebels have been stalled by persistent clashes between rival rebel groups and by continued killings. In early October the top rebel group was in Switzerland to prepare for the next round of talks, while the government said that it had finalized a set of counter proposals for the resumption of direct negotiations. Japan's special envoy arrived in Sri Lanka on 27 October for a 7-day visit to encourage an early resumption of peace talks. Japan is optimistic and has promised continued assistance for the country's reconstruction.

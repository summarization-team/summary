Cat Stevens, a successful singer/songwriter for two decades, abandoned his music career, converted to Islam, and changed his name to Yusuf Islam 30 years ago. He has devoted himself to charity and peace campaigns and to single-faith Islamic schools in Britain, but denies supporting terrorist activities. In September 2004, when Islam was barred from entering the United States because his name appeared on the "no-fly" list of people deemed as security risks, he vowed to find out why he was barred. Islam received the Man of Peace Prize for his work promoting peace, reconciling people, and condemning terrorism.

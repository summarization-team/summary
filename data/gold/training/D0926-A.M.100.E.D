Steve Fossett left Monday evening from Salina on a solo, nonstop, non-refueled flight around the world in the Global Flyer. He estimated flying time at 60-80 hours. He took off at 6:47 and was concerned for a brief moment when the plane seemed to lose altitude seconds after taking off. By 10 PM he approached Canadian airspace and soared toward the Atlantic Ocean. While flying across Canada Fossett's GPS malfunctioned. After a couple of hours the GSP corrected itself. Monitoring fuel usage was a critical challenge during the flight. Fossett flew over Africa and the Middle East on Tuesday.

Following her son's April 2004 death in Iraq, Cindy Sheehan has made regular public appearances across the nation protesting the war. She co-founded Gold Star Families for Peace. On August 8, 2005, Sheehan led an antiwar protest down the road leading to President Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas. She and about 50 antiwar activists established a roadside camp not far from the ranch, vowing to remain until Bush met with her. She used the internet to garner publicity. By August 11, several dozen protesters from across the country had joined Sheehan at Camp Casey, named for her fallen son.

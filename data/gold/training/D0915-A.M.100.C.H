Despite heavy security measures, scores of attacks targeted Iraqi polling places throughout the country in the days preceding the Sunday January 30 Iraqi elections, with some 40 polling stations destroyed. Casualties, including Iraqi policemen, soldiers, a child, and a woman, were low because most of the buildings were not occupied. The attacks struck polling places in Baghdad, Tikrit, Samarra, Basra, Kirkuk, Al-Dur, Baiji, Shorgat, and Moqdadiya. Violence is expected to escalate on Sunday and continue after the elections. Many Sunnis are expected to boycott the elections, but a high turnout is expected among Shiites and Kurds.

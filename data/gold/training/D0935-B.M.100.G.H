As of 13 April, the Nationals were tied for first in their division. They won their opening home game 5-3 over Arizona before a sold-out stadium and by 11 June had won 10 of 11 games. More than 22,000 season tickets have been sold and the team may make a pre-tax profit of $20 million in its first season. Attendance has been strong. Legal problems have limited their television exposure. Some Washingtonians have protested that money should be spent on new schools, not a stadium.

Rita, expected to become a major storm, is tracking a path that could follow that of Katrina. By Wednesday, Rita was upgraded to category three. President Bush declared a state of emergency in Texas and Louisiana as those states were bracing for Rita. As many as one million people were ordered to evacuate along the Gulf Coast. Rita was expected to land somewhere along the Texas gulf coast between Galveston and Corpus Christi and Texas Governor Perry has urged residents to begin evacuating. It poses a risk to the entire Houston region and has been upgraded to category four.

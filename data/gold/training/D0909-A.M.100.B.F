The US-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998 ended three decades of violence and created a power-sharing plan in Northern Ireland. It required a complete end to IRA paramilitarism and criminality, and decommissioning of IRA weapons. Power-sharing collapsed in 2002 following continued IRA underground activities. In 2005 Gerry Adams, leader of Catholic Sinn Fein, appealed to IRA members to give up violence in favor of democratic methods, followed by similar appeals by Irish PM Bertie Ahern and Protestant party leader Ian Paisley. Adams, Martin McGuinness and Martin Ferris resigned from the IRA paramilitary council, severing its political and military wings.

Four US ex-presidents, a Hollywood legend, a retired fireman and a star TV journalist were among the 31 appointed in December 2004 to lead the project for a memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001, attack on New York's World Trade Center. They were to be directors of the foundation that would construct, own, operate and maintain the memorial. Architect Michael Arad's design was chosen from 5,201 entries in an international competition. It featured two reflecting pools surrounded by gardens. Part of the $500 million in financing will come from New York's $816 million in federal grants.

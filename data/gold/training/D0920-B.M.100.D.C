Yusuf Islam, whose birthday is July 21, will host a concert in Jakarta to raise money for tsunami disaster victims. He will perform his song, Indian Ocean, written for the occasion. Proceeds from the song's recording would go to aid tsunami-orphaned children through his charity, Small Kindness. Two British newspapers paid unspecified damages to Islam over articles suggesting he had links to terrorists. Islam said the money would be given to relief projects in areas hit by the December Indian Ocean tsunami. The US government still has not explained why his name was added to the no-fly list.

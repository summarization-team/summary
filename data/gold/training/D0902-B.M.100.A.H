Several Democratic senators including Kennedy, Clinton, Mikulski, and Murray wanted to delay confirmation of President Bush's nominee to head the FDA until a decision was made on whether the morning-after pill could be sold without prescription. Some pharmacists around the country were refusing to fill prescriptions for any birth control pills, claiming that they violate their beliefs. At least eleven states allow pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions for religious reasons. Massachusetts may join six other states in allowing the pill to be sold without a prescription and four states are considering laws requiring pharmacists to fill all prescriptions.

Betty Friedan's 1963 controversial bestseller "The Feminine Mystique" made her the leading spokeswoman for a revitalized women's movement. Her pioneering book identified the unhappiness of post-WWII American women unfulfilled by traditional domesticity. She was an advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment and pushed for legal abortion. She helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966 and was its first president, splitting with them over their emphasis on lesbian issues and alienating men. She led the 1970 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality. She was a founder of the Women's Political Caucus and NARAL. She wrote "The Second Stage" in 1981.

Ending years of speculation, Prince Charles announced in February that he will marry Camilla Parker Bowles April 8th in a civil service at Windsor Castle. Camilla will be called her royal highness the duchess of Cornwall and later princess consort, rather than Princess of Wales or Queen Camilla. Queen Elizabeth, Charles' two sons, PM Tony Blair, and the Archbishop of Canterbury all approved the marriage. An Act of Parliament will be needed and is expected. Reaction among the population was mixed. The Archbishop will officiate at a prayer and dedication service in the chapel of St. George following the ceremony.

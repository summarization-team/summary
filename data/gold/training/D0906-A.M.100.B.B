Southern California was drenched by rainstorms in January 2005. Los Angeles had 15 inches in the first nine days. The rains caused severe flooding, sinkholes and mudslides resulting in huge property losses, blocked roads, power outages, hundreds of auto accidents, interruptions of rail traffic, and, by Jan. 10th, twenty deaths. Heroic efforts by hundreds of overtaxed rescue workers saved thousands from collapsed houses, mud piles and floodwaters. Sensitive listening devices and cadaver dogs searched for signs of life in mountains of mud and debris. By Jan 12th good weather was forecast for later in the week.

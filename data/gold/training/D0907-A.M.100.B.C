John Yoo is a constitutional scholar and law professor at UC Berkeley. He is a prolific writer and a regular contributor to opinion pages of major newspapers. As a Justice Department lawyer from 2001 to 2003, Yoo helped write a series of controversial memos to the White House following the 9/11 attacks. One memo concluded that the president has the authority to wage preemptive war. Another advised that the Geneva Convention does not apply to al-Qaida and Taliban non-state terror organizations. Yoo believes the US should not divulge which interrogation methods short of torture it might use with terror suspects.

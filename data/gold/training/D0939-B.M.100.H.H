It appeared that Alvarez had not slashed his wrists and that his other wounds were not life-threatening. He was charged with murder. Arson was added to the murder charges because forensic tests had revealed the presence of gasoline in and on the SUV and witnesses said that they had seen him douse the car before abandoning it. Alvarez might have intended to create a spectacular scene to get his wife's sympathy. In May he pleaded not guilty to murder and arson charges. Prosecutors will seek the death penalty.

In the night of October 7, 2004, suspected terrorist car bombs ripped through three Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular with vacationing Israelis. At least 30 people were killed and at least 100 were wounded. Last month, Israeli intelligence warned Israelis to keep out of the Sinai desert, citing information about possible attacks. The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the north of the Gaza Strip. The previously unheard of World Islamist Group claimed responsibility for the Taba Hilton Hotel blast, saying it was in revenge for Palestinians and Arabs killed in Palestine and Iraq.

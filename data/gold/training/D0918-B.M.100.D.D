Betty Friedan helped to empower women to fight for parity with men in the workplace, equal jobs, pay and respect. She encouraged them to reject the "contented homemaker" role and demand fuller participation in life. Some considered her the most influential woman of the second millennium. She raised issues such as paid maternity leave, affordable childcare, job training for women and reproductive self determination, which were radical in the 1960's but are still important today. Some feminists felt she focused too much on the concerns of white middle class married women instead of all women.

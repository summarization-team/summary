The Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases on March 2nd about the conditions under which the government could display the Ten Commandments and whether such displays violated the First Amendment. The Texas case concerns a 40-year-old granite monument of the Ten Commandments, one of 17 monuments on the grounds of the state capital. The Kansas case concerns framed copies of the Ten Commandments which hang with non-religious documents in two county courthouses. The displays have been modified twice in response to lower court rulings. Justice O'Connor is expected to cast the swing votes.

Descending through poisonous haze, the Huygens space probe landed on Titan January 14, 2005. Photographs it took near the surface revealed a frigid realm of apparent rivers, lakes and icy boulders. Scientists were ecstatic at having achieved the first spacecraft landing on the moon of another planet. The scientific feat, 25 years in the making, represented the farthest from Earth that a spacecraft had ever landed, about 890 million miles away. Titan's dense hydrocarbon smog suggests complex chemical processes like those that led to life on Earth. European scientists built Huygens to learn more by probing the moon's surface.

Yusuf Islam hosted a benefit concert for tsunami relief in Jakarta, Indonesia in January 2005 and recorded the song "Indian Ocean" to provide aid to tsunami orphaned children. His charity Small Kindness set up an office in Indonesia to assist the orphans. Islam said in February 2005 that his work was adversely affected when two British newspapers alleged he had been involved in terrorism. The newspapers apologized, paid his legal fees, and promised not to repeat the allegations. A year after he was barred from entering the US, the government had not revealed its reason for doing so.

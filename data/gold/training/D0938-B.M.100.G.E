Elements of the original design for the WTC memorial have been whittled away by logistical realities, client demands and concerns expressed by family members of the 2,749 WTC victims. The Freedom Tower meant to rise from the ashes will be redesigned because of security concerns. The proposed reduction of four pedestrian ramps to two raised safety concerns. The memorial itself is expected to cost $350M including the Memorial Center - a separate design. Governor Pataki assigned his chief of staff to coordinate the work of each agency and institution involved in the redevelopment of and around the memorial.

Apple rolled out its new Intel-based Mac computer in January 2006, six months early. An Intel-based laptop was to go on sale in February. An Intel processor inside a Macintosh put a whole library of Windows-based games and software within the reach of Mac users. Though there were benefits, skeptics questioned Apple's move; in the past, major transactions have lost customers and software developers. Apple helped launch a consortium designed to create new standards to improve the flow of content between TVs, computers and other devices. Speculation is that Apple plans to introduce a Mac Mini computer home entertainment hub.

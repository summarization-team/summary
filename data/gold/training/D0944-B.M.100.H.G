On March 1, 2005, the US Supreme Court declared that the death sentence for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds was cruel and unusual punishment, thus violating the 8th Amendment. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion citing the emotional immaturity of teenagers, the changing national consensus, and the weight of international opinion against executing minors. The dissenting opinions disputed these points. Justice O'Connor voted with the conservatives, Rehnquist, Thomas and Scalia.

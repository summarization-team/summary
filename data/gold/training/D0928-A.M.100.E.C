The first grand larceny trial of former Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski and codefendant Mark Swartz ended in mistrial. Their retrial began January 18. They allegedly stole $600 million from the company in unauthorized compensation and the sale of inflated Tyco stock. Kozlowski could face 30 years in prison. Prosecutors are focusing less on Kozlowski's life of excess and more on how he allegedly looted the company. In opening arguments, the defense suggested the compensation was legitimate, and company directors might be practicing revisionist history. Kozlowski still faces separate tax, conspiracy, falsifying business records and evidence tampering charges.

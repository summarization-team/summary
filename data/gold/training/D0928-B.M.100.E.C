In the prosecution's case, former Tyco executives were questioned, sometimes for days, about their knowledge or lack thereof about loans forgiven and bonuses paid to Dennis Kozlowski. On April 27, he took the stand in his defense. He denied abusing company loans and bonuses, testifying that the compensation committee leader, who has since died, approved them. He did admit to forgetfully omitting $25 million bonus that did not appear on his 1999 tax return. Cross-examination, which began on April 28, turned decidedly contentious by the third day. Kozlowski maintained his innocence and defended his lavish spending throughout.

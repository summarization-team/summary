Huygens landed safely on an apparently solid, but soft surface of Titan on January 14. The first photographs brought gasps and cheers from the scientists. They appeared to reveal drainage channels, flooded plains, shore lines, and a surface strewn with frozen blocks. Huygens had gathered environment data and photographs for 3 hours during its descent and for 10 minutes on the surface before the batteries died. The mission was declared a fantastic success and its output will be studied for years.

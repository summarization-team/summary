Jill Carroll, a 28-year old US journalist for the Christian Science Monitor was kidnapped in western Baghdad on her way to interview a prominent Sunni politician. She is the 31st media worker kidnapped there since 2003. Gunmen stopped her car and surrounded Carroll and her interpreter. The driver said the abduction took only a few seconds. The body of the interpreter was later found in the same neighborhood as the attack. An Arab TV network ran a video showing Carroll with a message that she would be killed unless the US freed all female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours.

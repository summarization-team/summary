The World Trade Center memorial project has bogged down while negotiations over issues of condemnation and imminent domain are hashed out. Design revisions have further complicated the project. Family members of 9/11 victims expressed displeasure with many of the proposed amendments to Arad's design. They believe the memorial has taken a backseat to commercial interests and have called for a fundraising boycott. New York's governor announced he will appoint his chief of staff to take control of the rebuilding effort. He will also use public funds to jumpstart the fundraising effort. A temporary memorial will open on July 11.

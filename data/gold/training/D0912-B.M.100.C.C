Over 100 protesters have joined Sheehan's roadside camp. On August 13, over 350 rallied at the site, undaunted by an earlier counter rally across the road. Sheehan vows to remain through Bush's August vacation, unless he meets with her. To get her message out, Sheehan has received aid from public relations and political operatives and a television spot. As local residents have grown irritated by the stream of protesters, Sheehan announced plans to move the camp to a field offered by one of Bush's neighbors. They plan to complete the move before a dusk candlelight vigil on August 17.

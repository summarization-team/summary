January 13, the rain had stopped and cleanup was underway. Many roads had yet to be cleared. The early January storms claimed 28 lives. A late February storm pummeled southern California for six days. Falling trees, mudslides, rockslides, tornadoes, floods, washed out roads and bridges, and sinkholes threatened residents' safety and homes. At least nine deaths were attributed to this storm, and dozens of homes were condemned. Over 100 were rendered temporarily uninhabitable. Los Angeles opened its Emergency Operations Center to better coordinate its storm response. Damage from the January and February storms could top $100 million.

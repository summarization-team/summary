American businessman Niall O'Dowd brokered IRA-US talks leading to a 1994 cease-fire. The 1998 accord established Northern Ireland's local government. In December 2004 Sinn Fein rejected Protestant demands that IRA arms destruction be photographed, halting political progress. Following Gerry Adams' April 2005 appeal to lay down arms the IRA consulted with members. Sinn Fein leaders visited the US but entry was denied to fugitive Rita O'Hare. In July the IRA declared an end to violence. It ordered all its units to dump arms, inviting Protestant and Catholic clergymen to serve as witnesses. The IRA refused to disband as Protestants demanded.

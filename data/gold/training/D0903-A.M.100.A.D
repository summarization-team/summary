Spain loaned the Philippines $4.4 million for a solar project to provide electricity to nearly 300 thousand rural households, schools, potable water systems, and health centers. Portugal planned to begin work on the world's biggest solar power station in 2006. The project, built by BP, was expected to create 240 jobs. The California counties of Fresno and Madera operate 500 solar electricity systems and Long Island powers 560 homes and businesses by solar energy. Italy developed a solar power train that powers air conditioning, illumination, and safety systems. Japan and Wales use solar panels for a portion of train power.

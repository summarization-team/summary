The feminist movement split, and Betty Friedan, who helped to start it, was sidelined. She resigned as the first president of the National Organization for Women after only a few years, as other women radicalized the movement. When she died at age 85 in 2006, newspapers had to remind readers that before Betty Friedan and the work of the movement she helped to start, equal pay for equal work, sex-blind help-wanted ads, the right of pregnant women to keep their jobs, non-discriminatory admissions standards for professional schools and many other matters were considered not only controversial, but radical proposals.

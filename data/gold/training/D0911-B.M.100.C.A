In March, 2005, when Iceland granted citizenship to Bobby Fischer, allowing him to escape extradition to the U.S. from a Japanese prison, a Japanese official said there was no reason to hold him longer. Supporters said he had lost weight and grown a long beard during his eight months in prison. U.S. officials prepared to file tax evasion charges against Fischer, who had not paid taxes on the $3 million he won playing chess in Yugoslavia in 1972. Fischer had renounced U.S. citizenship, but they noted that did not allow citizens to escape prosecution for crimes in the U.S.

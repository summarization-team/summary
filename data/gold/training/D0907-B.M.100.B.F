Yoo helped draft the Patriot Act and a memo narrowly defining torture, and wrote "The Powers of War and Peace". He thinks the US should be ruthless in disrupting terrorist networks, perhaps setting up false terrorist organizations to sow confusion. He opposes banning secret prisons and harsh interrogations. He advocates extraordinary presidential powers, including making war and interpreting laws. A Federalist Society member, Yoo says Supreme Court nominee John Roberts takes a traditional approach to the law, arguing facts instead of pushing big new theories. Roberts seeks to put biases and feelings aside but doesn't claim he can or should.

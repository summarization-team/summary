The Patriot Act included major sections that expire in 2005 if not renewed by Congress. The Bush administration calls for complete renewal, but liberals and some conservatives maintain that the law gives the federal government too much power. Bush threatens to veto any congressional weakening of the Act. The specific sections are targeted by an unusual left-right coalition. The sections attacked are: the one permitting easy access to records in terrorism-related cases; the provision for "sneak and peek" secret searches before a warrant is presented; and an overbroad definition of "terrorists" that could include non-terrorist suspects.

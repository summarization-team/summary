China's legislature adopted the anti-secession law 2,896 to zero on 14 March. The Chinese Premier declared that the law was designed to strengthen ties across the Taiwan Strait, that it was aimed not at mobilizing for war but at maintaining peace, and that it would encourage cooperation. In reply, Taiwan's ruling party condemned the law, claiming that it severely infringed on the freedom, dignity, and security of the Taiwanese, and asked the international community to denounce it. The U.S. expressed grave concern over the law, but a majority of countries supported it.

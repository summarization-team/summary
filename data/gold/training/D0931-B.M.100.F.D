International investigators uncovered evidence showing that Q.A. Khan agreed to sell Iran a nuclear weapons program 18 years ago. In February 2005 Time reported that the US was investigating whether QA Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and other countries and that Khan had also played a bigger role in helping North Korea with nuclear programs than had been previously reported. The article said the US suspects Khan did business with Al-Qaeda but lacks concrete evidence. Pakistan dismissed the article as baseless, without facts, and full of distortion.

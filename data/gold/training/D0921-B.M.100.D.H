Jury selection for Jackson's trial was delayed on Monday 15 January when he was rushed to the hospital with the flu. He left the hospital Wednesday. The trial started on 31 January and a jury of four men and eight women was selected on 23 February. On 28 February the judge read a nine-page indictment detailing the charges of child molestation and conspiracy against Jackson. He was accused of giving a young boy alcohol and surfing pornographic websites with him and his brother and of trying to ensure that the boy's family did not publicly denounce him.

Hong Kong Disneyland (HKD) officially opened as planned on Sept. 12 with about 16,000 people attending including the Chinese vice president. Workers at HKD soon complained of long hours without break and quick turnarounds, raising the issue of unionization. HKD repeatedly refused a release of attendance figures. By November HKD offered discount tickets to residents of Hong Kong and on Nov. 21 a press report said attendance was falling below earlier government projections. On Nov. 22 Disney replied that "well over" 1 million people had visited HKD and that "attendance is ramping up well."

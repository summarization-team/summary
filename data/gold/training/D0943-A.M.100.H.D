Two Sikhs, Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagri, were charged with the 1985 bombing of an Air India jet that killed 329 passengers and with killing two baggage handlers at Narita Airport. Final arguments in their murder trial concluded in December 2004. Prosecutors believe the Sikhs' motive was to avenge India's 1984 attack on the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The trial was not settled due to years of bungled police work, unexpected killings of witnesses and a suspect, and vague and contradictory testimonies. Justice Ian Josephson, who heard the case without a jury, will deliver his decision in March 2005.

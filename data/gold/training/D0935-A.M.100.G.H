Major league baseball owners approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington, D.C., on 3 December if the DC government could provide funding for a new ballpark by 31 December. An agreement was reached on 22 December for a 400-million-dollar stadium. The new Washington Nationals would play in RFK Stadium until the new ballpark could be built. The Nationals won their first exhibition game in Florida on 22 March, defeating the NY Mets 5-3, and were scheduled to make their DC debut in an exhibition game against the Mets at RFK stadium on 3 April.

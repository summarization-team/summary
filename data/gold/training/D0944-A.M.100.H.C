On October 13, 2004, the Supreme Court struggled over the legality of the death penalty for criminals under age 18 in Roper v. Simmons. Simmons' attorney argued that a national consensus has emerged that the death penalty for juveniles is cruel and unusual punishment. He compared this case to the 2002 case in which the court abolished the death penalty for mentally retarded offenders. The Missouri Attorney General argued that the court should uphold the execution of minors because some crimes are so heinous as to warrant it. Justices Kennedy's and Day O'Connor's votes are likely to be pivotal.

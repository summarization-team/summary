After 33 years of no baseball, in late December 2004, all parties agreed to move the Montreal Expos baseball team to Washington, D.C. After many snags, Mayor Williams reached a compromise approved by both Major League Baseball and the city council. The team, renamed the Nationals, will play in RFK Stadium until a city-financed, $500-million stadium is completed for the 2008 season. The Nationals sold 20,000 season tickets. They will play the first game in Washington on April 3 and the first regular season game there on the 14th. President Bush will attend. The Orioles owner continues to threaten litigation.

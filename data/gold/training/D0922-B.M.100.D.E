Delayed Notification Searches (called sneak and peek) are the central issue regarding extending, modifying or curbing executive powers under the Patriot Act. The Justice Department urges extension. The ACLU and some conservative libertarians call for curbing powers. Five state legislatures and several communities have passed resolutions to limit executive powers. A bill by Senators Durbin and Craig would amend the Act. A draft bill by Senator Roberts Intelligence Committee would extend FBI powers. Gonzales said at one point the search authority had been used 35 times. Later, that figure was given as 155 times as of January 2005.

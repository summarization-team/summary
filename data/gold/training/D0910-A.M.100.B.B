Negotiations under the Norwegian-sponsored peace process of February 2002 between The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the government of Sri Lanka were at a standstill in October 2004 due in part to internecine struggles within the LTTE. The main LTTE in northern Sri Lanka was challenged by a faction in the east with a leader known as Karuma who broke ranks in March 2004. While LTTE sought support in Europe and Japan offered help in resumption of negotiations, Sri Lanka blamed LTTE for breakdown of the peace process which has been stalled since April 2003.

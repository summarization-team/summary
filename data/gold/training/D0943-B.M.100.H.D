In March 2005 Judge Josephson acquitted Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagir on eight counts of murder and conspiracy because the government had failed to make a conclusive case. Plane crash victims' families were devastated and demanded a public inquiry. The Canadian Deputy Prime Minister could see no benefit to calling a public inquiry. The Canadian Police were disappointed at the call. Prosecutors sought grounds to appeal Josephson's ruling. Canada's newspapers were shocked at the acquittals of the two Sikhs and the Toronto-based Globe and Mail devoted its front page to the headline "innocent" and the names of the 329 victims.

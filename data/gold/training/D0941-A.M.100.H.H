The Huygens space probe, built and managed by the European Space Agency, was carried by NASA's Cassini spacecraft on a 7-year journey to Saturn. It separated successfully from Cassini on Christmas Eve and began a 2.5-million-mile 20-day descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan, the only moon in the solar system that has atmosphere. During its descent it will sample Titan's atmosphere. Everything must work perfectly because there is no way to adjust Huygens' course. Progress was being carefully followed by NASA and the 16 European nations involved in the project.

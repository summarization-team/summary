In November 2003 police arrested Michael Jackson on several counts of child molestation after having raided his California ranch. Jackson's attorney accused the District Attorney of having a vendetta against Jackson and alleged in a lawsuit that private conversations used as evidence had been illegally recorded. Jackson had problems with his legal team. Rapper Eminem issued a video showing a Jackson look-alike on a bed with children. A former business associate seeking $3 million sued for breach of contract and a merchant sued to collect nearly $180,000. In December 2003 investigators searched Jackson's ranch and took DNA from his mouth.

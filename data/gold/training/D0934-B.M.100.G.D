The Palestinian Minister of State said Arafat's body would be brought to Cairo where world leaders could pay their respects and then to the West Bank for his funeral. The hospital where Arafat had lain in a coma confirmed that he died on November 11 at 3:30 am but gave no details. Palestinian authorities declared a 40-day mourning period and ordered businesses to close for three days. Hours after Arafat's death Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They tightened security at Jewish settlements before the funeral. Only Palestinians with permits were allowed to attend Arafat's funeral.

On February 10, 2005, Britain's Prince Charles announced he would wed Camilla Parker Bowles on April 8. The festivities will be a civil ceremony in Windsor Castle, followed by a prayer service, led by the Bishop of Canterbury, in the castle's chapel. The couple chose the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall for Camilla and HRH Princess Consort when Charles becomes king. The Queen, the royal family, and the British Prime Minister supported the announcement. Only an Act of Parliament is still needed. British citizens' reactions were mixed. That evening Camilla displayed her engagement ring at a gala castle dinner.

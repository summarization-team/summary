British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson has acquitted the two Canadian Sikhs ending the four-year trial that was conducted without a jury. He said that despite the horrific nature of the alleged crimes, there could be no lowering the standard of proof and that the assortment of prosecution witnesses lacked credibility. The decision devastated family members of the victims. Shocked prosecutors must ponder whether there is ground for appeal and defend their decision to bring the case to court. The feasibility of an appeal is in question because of strong wording of Josephson's verdict. The case remains open.

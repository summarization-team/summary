One way to get rid of carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants is to bury it. Carbon sequestration is not new; petroleum producers have pumped compressed CO2 into oil-bearing structures to force oil to the surface for years. Norway has buried 70 million tons below the North Sea. Carbon dioxide from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is pumped 185 miles to a working oilfield in Canada. In 2004 scientists planned to sequester carbon in deep sandstone deposits. Coal gasification is necessary for sequestration. Improving the two technologies was part of a $35 billion package the Senate considered in 2005.

A special Japanese envoy met with the Sri Lankan government 27-30 Oct. and on Nov. 1 left for the north for talks with LTTE. Norwegian Foreign Minister Petersen, preceded by violence and increased security, arrived in Colombo on Nov. 9 in a fresh attempt to revive peace talks. Petersen said he did not have "high expectations." LTTE announced on Nov. 16 that it was prepared to start peace talks on the basis of its proposed Self-Governing Authority. Petersen's lack of "high expectations" was borne out by outbreaks of violence in eastern Sri Lanka Nov. 17-22.

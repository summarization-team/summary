There are statistical studies and partial explanations of the cause of schizophrenia, but no complete theory. Children born of older fathers are at higher risk. No schizophrenia-causing gene has been identified, but a few victims display a gene-mutation associated with Rett syndrome. Heavy daily use of marijuana starting before age 15 causes increased risk, but the risk decreases with age. Australian researchers found thinning of the outer layer of grey matter in the brain of victims. Other studies suggest environmental and social factors or natural chemical changes in a person's genome.

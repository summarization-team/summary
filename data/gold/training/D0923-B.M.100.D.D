The Real ID Act, enacted in May 2005, required that in three years states determine whether driver's license applicants are in the country legally. Civil libertarians and immigration rights activists protested the bill. States blasted the bill because it placed a large burden on them and worker training requirements. They believed the Act grossly underestimated financial, logistical and technological demands. Some states need to amend their laws and others need to overhaul their computing systems to verify the accuracy of documents. The bill is expected to be phased in over a 5-year period, beginning in 2008.

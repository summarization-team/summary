Abdul Qadeer Khan was a nuclear scientist who oversaw the spread of nuclear weapons to US adversaries. Khan did more to undermine US causes than Bin Laden, having confessed to transferring nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. In November 2004 US officials and the UN's IAEA were still searching for other countries with Khan's digitized blueprints for nuclear manufacturing equipment and uranium enrichment centrifuges user manuals. Khan's network spread across 30 countries. Khan lives under house arrest in Islamabad. He was granted full pardon and allowed to keep the money believed to be from illicit sales.

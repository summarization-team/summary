The Michael Jackson trial got underway on Jan. 31, 2005. On Feb. 15 jury selection was delayed when Jackson was rushed to the hospital with the flu. He was discharged after 23 hours. On Feb. 28 the presiding judge revealed details of the charges for the first time. The prosecutor in opening arguments stated that Jackson's "world was rocked" in February 2003 by broadcast of a British television documentary "Living With Michael Jackson." A friend called the effect "a train wreck," and the prosecutor said it resulted in a plot to kidnap the boy.

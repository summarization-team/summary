A UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests carbon dioxide emissions should be captured from generating plants and refineries then compressed and stored in geological formations, oceans or in minerals. Underground storage could use technology already developed by the oil and gas industry. The US Department of Energy estimates that one-third to one-half of the emissions released into the atmosphere could be eliminated by this methodology. BP and Edison International subsidiaries plan to build a plant in Carson, California, where 90% of the carbon dioxide would be captured and pumped into an oilfield. A similar Danish project is underway.

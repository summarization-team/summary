The conference, gathering 1,200 experts from some 30 countries, is focussing on the planet's alarming loss of biodiversity, as wild species are battered by habitat loss and climate change.
The calamity "brutally reminds us, on a global scale, how vulnerable and dependent we are on our natural environment, our way of living," said Koichiro Matsuura, director-general of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the venue for the conference.
Hamdallah Zedan, executive secretary of the UN's Biodiversity Convention, said the amplified toll from the tsunami--more than 227,000 dead--"vividly demonstrates" the cost of damaging the environment.

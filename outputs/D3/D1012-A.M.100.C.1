But Fillipos Koutsaftis could not rule out that the six people were unconscious when the Helios Airways Boeing 737-300, with six crew and 115 passengers, plunged 10,400 meters (34,000 feet) Sunday into a mountainous area near the village of Grammatiko, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Athens.
The man _ identified as Nektarios-Sotirios Voutas, 32 _ told Greek television stations that his cousin on board the plane sent him a cell-phone text message minutes before the crash saying: "Farewell, cousin, here we "'re" frozen."

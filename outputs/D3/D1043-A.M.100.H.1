The decision put an end to weeks of speculation on whether any of Hariri's sons would remain involved in politics following his assassination Feb. 14 in a massive bombing.
It said the decision was taken after a family meeting Wednesday that came at the end of the mourning period and was attended by Hariri's wife and their seven children.
The family of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri announced Wednesday that his second eldest son, Saad, would assume the political mantle left by the slain leader.

Fossett has set dozens of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.
A February 2 launch was cancelled because the jet stream moved too far north, which meant Fossett would lose too much fuel catching up to it to make it the rest of the way around the world.
With all preparations complete for a solo, non-stop flight around the globe, the only thing standing in the way of the legendary adventurers next attempt to set a world record is an uncooperative jet stream.

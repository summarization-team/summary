WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua)--Americans spend 33 billion dollars a year on weight-loss programs as every one out of three has weight problems in the nation, but often they are not able to evaluate them or know whether they are dangerous, participants in a government conference were told today.
The Federal Trade Commission and several private and government health organizations sponsored the two-day conference on problems arising from the increases in obesity and weight-control programs.

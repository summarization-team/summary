Many of them gained unwanted pounds because they do not engage in regular exercise, sleep too much and eat food that is high in fat and calories, another survey of Beijing's overweight people showed.
A recent survey found that 12.6 percent of 4,895 adults and 11.35 percent of 9,093 children who live in urban Shanghai are obese, and these figures are close to the average weight proportion seen in developed countries, it was reported in today's "Wen Hui Bao Daily."

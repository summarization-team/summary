Indian police said Tuesday at least one person was injured when about 15 mortars were fired into India from Pakistan over the Line of Control.
Indian and Pakistani military commanders were to discuss Wednesday Indian charges that Pakistan fired mortar shells across the border into Indian-controlled Kashmir in violation of a 14-month ceasefire.
No one from Pakistan has fired and there is no ceasefire violation by Pakistan ,"Pakistan military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told AFP in Islamabad.

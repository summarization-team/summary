Oil production in Norway, disrupted by technical problems and aggravated due to a storm in the North Sea, will probably be reduced by 11.5 percent for at least a few more days, oil companies said on Wednesday.
Norway, the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia and which normally has an average daily production of three million barrels, has seen its production reduced by 345,000 barrels per day (bpd) since it shut down three offshore platforms.

They (the advisers) said we are in Iraq because they believed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, that the world's a better place with Saddam gone and that we "'re" making the world a safer place with what we "'re" doing over there," Sheehan said in a telephone interview after the meeting.
Sheehan, 48, did "n't" get to see Bush, but did talk about 45 minutes with national security adviser Steve Hadley and deputy White House chief of staff Joe Hagin, who went out to hear her concerns.

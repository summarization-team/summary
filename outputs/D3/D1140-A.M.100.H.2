The toll from floods in Bangladesh jumped Thursday to 54 people dead, with more than five million others displaced, after monsoon rains and Himalayan snowmelt caused rivers to overflow.
Among the 5.6 million people, 160,000 people have been given shelter in 614 flood shelters on high land in northern Bangladesh," he said.
Some 5.6 million people had been displaced or marooned in their homes by floodwater, he added.
The death toll from floods in Bangladesh rose to 65 on Friday as relief workers struggled to reach millions of people stranded in their villages without food or clean water, officials said.

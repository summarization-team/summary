The kidnappers, apparently connected to extremist Muslim insurgents in the Philippines, have demanded a $2.4 million ransom for the hostages, who are being held somewhere on the islands of Sulu province in the Philippines, officials said.
So far, neither the Philippines nor Malaysia has said it would negotiate a ransom.
Announcing he would meet with the rebel captors Friday, Misuari said the kidnappers saw the hostages as a treasure, and were unlikely to release them quickly.

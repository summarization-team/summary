Alarm in Finland over this week's high school massacre was heightened Friday by Internet threats indicating further attacks which led police to surround two more schools.
The jitters were caused by the fact that Pekka-Eric Auvinen, 18, had posted a video threat on YouTube before carrying out his murderous rampage on Wednesday, when he shot dead eight people at the Jokela High School in Tuusula before killing himself.
The slaughter in Jokela shows that even Finland is not safe from a contagious violence for which there is no vaccine," the paper stated in an editorial.

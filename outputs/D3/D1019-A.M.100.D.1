KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)--Six masked assailants have taken more than 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, hostage on a remote resort island in eastern Malaysia, police said Monday.
The abductors surprised and captured the group on a beach on Sipadan Island late Sunday, and two foreign tourists managed to escape the men, Semporna police chief Sulaiman Junaidi told The Associated Press by telephone.
The argument over the islands dates back to 1969, when Indonesia and Malaysia failed to reach agreement during technical discussions about the overlapping continental shelf that borders the neighboring countries.

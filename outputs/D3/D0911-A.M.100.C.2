Japan said Tuesday it may allow detained chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces prison if he is deported to the United States, to go to Iceland where he has been granted citizenship.
Fischer, 62, was on Monday made a citizen by the parliament of Iceland, where he is famous for a 1972 match in the capital Reykjavik.
All 40 members of Iceland's parliament who cast their votes were in favor of making Fischer a citizen, while two deputies abstained and 21 were absent.
She said she planned to move with Fischer to Iceland once he is released.

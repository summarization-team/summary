Chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces prison if he returns to the United States, can only avoid deportation from Japan if Iceland upgrades its granting of residency to full citizenship, a Japanese lawmaker said Wednesday.
Fischer's supporters accuse the United States of piling pressure both on Japan and Iceland so it can get ahold of the chess legend.
Fischer is little known in Japan.
Fischer, 62, who is in detention in Japan, faces prison if he returns to the United States.

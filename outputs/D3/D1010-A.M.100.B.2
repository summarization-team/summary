A gene may protect some people from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human brain wasting form of mad cow disease, researchers said Thursday.
Transmission from cow to human is limited by a barrier that usually disappears when the disease is passed from one animal to another of the same species, the scientists said.
Transgenic experiments on mice show that substitution of an aminoacid in the "prion" proteins will produce symptoms different from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), according to the study by British scientists to be published in Science magazine on Friday.

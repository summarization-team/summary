Coastlines that have proven tragically vulnerable to tsunamis should nurture healthy coral reefs, beds of sea grass and mangrove swamps, which are natural buffers against killer waves, speakers at the UN-backed biodiversity forum said.
The calamity "brutally reminds us, on a global scale, how vulnerable and dependent we are on our natural environment, our way of living," said Koichiro Matsuura, director-general of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the venue for the conference.

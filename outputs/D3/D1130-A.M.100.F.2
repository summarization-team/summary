It is far from where the ship originally sank but our last survivors were found by navy ships and aircraft in the waters off Madura and Bawean island," Simamora said.
Fifteen more survivors were found Wednesday near Madura island off East Java more than 300 kilometres east of where the ferry is thought to have sunk, Simamora said.
Strong winds and waves have carried survivors and liferafts east along the seas north of Java and also severely hampered search and rescue efforts.

New South Wales state Police Minister Carl Scully said white supremacists and neo-Nazis were among those involved in the attacks.
More than 30 people were injured and 16 were arrested in some of the worst racial violence in Australian history as riots spread from south Sydney's Cronulla beach on Sunday afternoon to neighbouring suburbs overnight.
More than 5,000 people gathered at Cronulla beach Sunday after email and mobile phone messages called on local residents to beat-up "Lebs and wogs"--racial slurs for people of Lebanese and Middle Eastern origin.

New driver's license rules tucked in a military spending bill will create national identification cards for Americans and stick state governments with the bill, Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander said.
Sensenbrenner's spokesman Jeff Lungren said the rules do not create a national ID card but are "merely settings standards for the states" and building on states "'" ongoing efforts to boost driver's license security.
Congress created a panel to negotiate new driver's license standards, but the new rules supersede the panel.

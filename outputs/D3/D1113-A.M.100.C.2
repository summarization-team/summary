Every time CITES authorises the sale of limited quantities of ivory, we witness an increase in poaching and illegal trade," said Bourama Niagate, head of the delegation and of nature conservation in Mali.
African states called Tuesday for a 20-year ban on trade in ivory to protect the continent's elephants from poachers and possible extinction in the wild.
Some 20,000 elephants are killed by poachers every year, according to the document.

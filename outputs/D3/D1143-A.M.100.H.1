Simpson, one of the most famous American football players of his generation during the 1970s, was the prime suspect in the brutal 1994 murders of estranged wife Nicole Brown-Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.
Simpson, who always has vehemently denied the killings, was acquitted of the slayings after a racially charged Los Angeles trial in 1995, a verdict that was greeted with widespread outrage across America.
The former sports star was subsequently found liable for the deaths in a 1997 civil suit and was ordered to pay damages to the victims "'" families totaling 33.5 million dollars.

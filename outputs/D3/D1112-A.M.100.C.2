A man found guilty of murder for causing a Los Angeles train crash that left 11 people dead should be jailed for life without parole, a jury recommended on Tuesday.
Alvarez's car was hit by a Los Angeles-bound train, which derailed and then ploughed into a train travelling in the opposite direction.
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 29, was convicted last month at Los Angeles Superior Court following a two-month trial.
Defense attorneys had argued that Alvarez was only trying to kill himself when he drove his gasoline-soaked Jeep on train tracks in suburban Glendale.

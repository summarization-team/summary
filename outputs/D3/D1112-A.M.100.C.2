Juan Alvarez parked his gasoline-doused sport utility vehicle on railroad tracks in January 2005, causing a Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train to derail and crash into another train going the other way.
Prosecutors said Alvarez was trying to get his estranged wife's attention the day of the crash.
The jury, which convicted Alvarez last month, had heard the prosecution describe him as a remorseless, smirking defendant who did "n't" think of the case as a tragedy.

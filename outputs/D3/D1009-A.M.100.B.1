If authorities are correct, James and Regena Rapp and their employees lied and schemed to get detailed personal information--bank and telephone records and credit-card bills--on the JonBenet Ramsey murder investigation.
Included in the court case file is a letter purportedly from John Ramsey to McGuckin Hardware, asking for information about credit card purchases by his wife for $46.31 and $99.88 just weeks before their daughter's body was found.

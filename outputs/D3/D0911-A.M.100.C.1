I have received a report that according to the immigration control law, it is legally possible to send him there as long as he obtains Iceland citizenship," Justice Minister Chieko Noono told reporters.
Japan said Tuesday it may allow detained chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces prison if he is deported to the United States, to go to Iceland where he has been granted citizenship.
Fischer, known for his eccentric behavior and outspoken criticism of his country, played a rematch against Spassky in 1992 in Yugoslavia in defiance of US sanctions imposed over the Balkan wars.

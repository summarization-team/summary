The final day of Blake's extensive defense case also featured his adult daughter, Delinah Blake-Hurwitz, testifying Wednesday about her adoption of the child and undergoing such a rigorous cross-examination by the prosecutor that many of the questions went unanswered when the judge ruled they were argumentative.

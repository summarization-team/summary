A jury in Los Angeles also found the 71-year-old star of the hit 1970s television detective series "Baretta" not guilty of solicitation to commit the murder of his wife of six months, Bonny Lee Bakley in May 2001.
The former child star put his head down on the defendant's table and sobbed as the Los Angeles jury foreman read out the not guilty verdicts after a three-month trial and eight days of deliberation by the panel.

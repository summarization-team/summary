The attack came after a near two-week breach of the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip which saw hundreds of thousands of people pouring into Egypt from the impoverished Hamas-run territory in a bid to break a crippling Israeli siege.
The blast, at a shopping mall near Israel's top-secret nuclear reactor, was the first suicide bombing on Israeli soil since the relaunch of peace talks at a US conference in November and the first since January last year.

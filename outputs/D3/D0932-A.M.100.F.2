Maathai, who serves as Kenya's deputy environment minister, pledged to push the Kenyan government to adopt measures to reduce the use of plastic bags.
By August that year, shoppers had already cut the use of plastic bags by 90 percent, the environment ministry announced.
The state-run Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA) and National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) said at least two million plastic bags a year were being distributed to shoppers in Nairobi alone, many of which were not disposed of properly.

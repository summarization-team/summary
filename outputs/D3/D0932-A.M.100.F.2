If everything goes as scheduled, the bill to ban free distribution of plastic bags will be sent to the parliament in 2006 at the earliest," an environment ministry official said.
There are no similar nationwide statistics, but we expect charging for plastic bags will reduce a significant amount of garbage from households," the environment ministry official said.

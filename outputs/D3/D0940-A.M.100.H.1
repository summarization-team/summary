The government, which owns a 57 percent stake in the three billion US dollar resort, said it expected 5.6 million visitors in its first year of operation, equivalent to an average daily attendance of 15,342.
A headcount of visitors to the park carried out by four reporters of the South China Morning Post showed that 12,972 people visited on Sunday November 13, and 11,399 entered on Wednesday November 16.
A Disneyland spokeswoman dismissed the headcount, saying: "Any attempt to count our attendance is flawed" while a Tourism Commission spokeswoman declined to reveal the figures for commercial reasons.

Officials said it was a frustrating day of searching where rescuers could see, but not reach, other bodies trapped in the wreckage of the collapsed bridge just east of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota.
White House spokesman Tony Snow said a 2005 federal report found "structural deficiencies" in the Minneapolis bridge which the state was responsible for repairing.
Concerns over the bridge were so severe that state officials considered bolting steel plates to its supports to prevent cracking in fatigued metal, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported Friday.

South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by businesses to politicians during 2002 presidential polls.
State prosecutors raided telephone offices across the capital on Monday to seize records and data related to illegal wiretapping by South Korea's spy agency, officials said.
Prosecutors are looking into records of wiretapping using our communication system," KT spokesman Koo Ja-Ho said.
GNP head Park Geun-Hye has accused Roh's progressive government of undermining South Korea's anti-communist national identity by opposing the arrest order.

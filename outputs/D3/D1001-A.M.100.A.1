The club added one insert with pictures of the prom and other activities that took place since February and another for those killed in the rampage.
The yearbook shows the senior pictures of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who killed 12 classmates and a teacher inside the school April 20 before taking their own lives.
She and her friends gave the yearbook--called Rebelations for the school's team name, the Rebels--a quick glance to see the photos of Harris and Klebold.

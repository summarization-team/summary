Sandra Day "O'Connor", the first woman appointed to the US Supreme Court and a frequent swing vote, has announced her retirement, a court source said Friday.
Her retirement, which sets up a long-awaited political battle for a successor and gives President George W. Bush his first chance to select a justice for the high court, was confirmed by a Supreme Court official who requested anonymity.

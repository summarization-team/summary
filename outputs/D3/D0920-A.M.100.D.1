A New York-bound British Airways plane was forced to change course over the Atlantic and head back to London Wednesday after US authorities said they would not allow one of its passengers to land, the airline said.
The Boeing 747, with 239 passengers aboard, was half-way to its destination when it decided to return to Heathrow Airport at 1115 GMT "because of a passenger that the American authorities did "n't" want to land in New York," said a BA spokesman.

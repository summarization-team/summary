Defense lawyer Rick Hernandez asked the military judge, Colonel James Pohl, to recuse himself because he had presided over all the other Abu Ghraib abuse cases.
When the judge said it made sense for one judge to preside over the "factually complicated cases" that had thousands of pages of supporting documents, Hernandez responded that the fact that England was going to enter a guilty plea meant the case would not be "complicated."

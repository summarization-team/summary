The man accused of causing a collision of two commuter trains that killed 11 people and injured nearly 200 pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder and arson charges.
Glendale police have said that while it initially appeared Alvarez was trying to commit suicide, the discovery of other evidence, including gasoline doused on the sport utility vehicle, showed he was trying to cause the crash.
Special circumstance allegations could result in the death penalty if Alvarez is convicted, but prosecutors say they have "n't" decided whether to seek a death sentence.

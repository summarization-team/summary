Katja and Claudia consider that they have recovered and began helping others like them last month by opening the first restaurant in Germany, and perhaps in all of Europe, where anorexics and bulimics can eat without feeling ashamed.
She has held down a number of different jobs and is convinced she can best help her clients, who often come in groups, like the members of the``Dick und duenn", or the Fat and Thin, association.

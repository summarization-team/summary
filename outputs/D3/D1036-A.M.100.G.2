Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
I said no," he said.
The day before he fell ill, Yushchenko said he did not eat all day until around 10:00 pm (2000 GMT), when he had dinner with friends.

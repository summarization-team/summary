Dr. Ken Steier, a critical care physician and pulmonologist at Nassau University Medical Center in New York, said children have been rushed into the emergency room there suffering from adverse effects from over-the-counter medications.
CDC investigators found in a study of children treated in emergency rooms nationwide between 2004 and 2005 that three babies younger than 6 months had died and more than 1,500 required urgent care for adverse reactions to non-prescription cough and cold preparations.

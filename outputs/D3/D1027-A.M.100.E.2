(AP)--Two men who opposed the death penalty were dismissed as potential jurors in the first-degree murder trial of a man charged in the beating death of a gay college student.
Fourteen potential jurors were released Thursday from the trial of Russell Henderson, who faces the death penalty if convicted in the Oct. 6 attack on Matthew Shepard.
Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, are accused of luring Shepard out of a bar, pistol-whipping him and tying him to a fence.

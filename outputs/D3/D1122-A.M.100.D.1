The 40-year-old arch bridge which rises 64 feet (20 meters) over the river was undergoing repairs at the time of the accident, and there were reports that construction workers were using a jackhammer at the time of the collapse, AFP has learned.
The bridge was under construction at the time of the accident and only one lane was open in either direction when it collapsed shortly after 6 pm (2300 GMT), right in the middle of the local rush hour.

NFL commissioner Goodell has his own investigation into the dogfight scandal and his willingness, or lack thereof, to allow Vick into the NFL after a guilty plea could be a major factor in Vick's choice to deal or fight.
Vick, who faces up to five years in prison and 250,000 dollars in fines, could face a superseding indictment with more charges against him, and harsher potential punishments, if he elects to fight the case rather than make a deal.
Another co-defendant, Troy Taylor, already signed a document saying the charges against Vick and the others are true.

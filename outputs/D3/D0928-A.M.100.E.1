Former top executives L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz are awaiting retrial in federal court in New York on charges of stealing $600 million (euro483.33 million) from the company.
But U.S. District Judge Paul Barbadoro on Thursday struck down a related claim that sought damages on behalf of Tyco stemming from allegations of fraud and corporate looting.
In the class-action lawsuit, shareholders seek damages against the company, Kozlowski; Swartz; Mark Belnick, former director Frank Walsh; and the company's auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers.

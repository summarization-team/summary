US media also reported on Sunday that China was the top violator of US food safety standards, with US authorities last month rejecting 257 Chinese food shipments--far more than from any other country.
China said Tuesday it was willing to work with the world community on improving food security as it responded to growing global concerns about the safety of edible Chinese exports.
China was already involved in cooperation with the United States, the European Union, Japan and South Korea on strengthening food security, she said.

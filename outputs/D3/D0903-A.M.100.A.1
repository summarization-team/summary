The Economy and Innovation Ministry said Wednesday it approved a project to install solar panels over 114 hectares (280 acres) in southeastern Portugal, one of Europe's sunniest spots.
It imports about 86 percent of its energy, according to government figures, and high oil prices are hindering efforts to revive the stagnant economy.
The Portuguese government has granted an operating license for a huge solar energy power station that its backers claim will be the world's largest.

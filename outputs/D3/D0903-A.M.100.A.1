Under the United Nations Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty on global warming which Lisbon has signed, Portugal must generate 39 percent of its electricity needs through renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.
The plant will have 350,000 solar panels spread over 114 hectares (280 acres) near the southern town of Moura and will be able to produce 62 megawatts, more than six times the largest existing solar power station in Germany.
The construction of the station will begin in 2006, it is irreversible," Moura mayor Jose Maria Pos-de-Mina was quoted as saying by Lusa news agency.

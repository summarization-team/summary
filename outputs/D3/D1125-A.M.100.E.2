The hunting of bear cubs and pregnant bears is banned.
There is a complete ban on the hunting of polar bears between July 1 and September 30.
Hunters, who can get up to 2,685 euros (3,500 dollars) for a bear pelt, had been killing around 250 bears a year before the first quota of 150 kills was introduced for 2006.
The study is likely to give ammunition to conservation groups that want polar bears to be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

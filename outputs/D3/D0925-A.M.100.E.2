Jobs revealed that Apple has been working on the move for at least five years, creating two versions of its Mac OS X operating system for both the current Mac chips and those built by Intel.
On Monday, neither Apple nor Intel would specify the exact chips that will be used.
But when Apple switched from Motorola 68000 processors to PowerPC chips, the Mac's share dropped to below 5 percent.
Apple continued to sell systems based on non-Intel processors and its own software.

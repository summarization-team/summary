The low water levels come as the government seeks to control the flow of the river during the ongoing dry season to safeguard water supply for cities and hydro-electric dams in the river's middle reaches, the paper said.
High temperatures this winter, a lack of rain fall in the upper reaches and rising industrial and agricultural water use has resulted in low water levels in the river at Lanzhou city, capital of Gansu province, the China News Service said.

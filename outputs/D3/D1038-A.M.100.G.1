Mount St. Helens spewed out more steam on Monday after new seismic tremors that led some experts to warn the volcano could explode at any time.
The volcano ejected steam followed by "a small amount of ash" in an eruption that lasted some 10 minutes at 9:47am (1647 GMT), said Tim McBicker, a spokesman for the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Monday's eruption was similar to one on Friday that sent a huge cloud of steam and some ash into the air, USGS spokeswoman Catherine Puckett told AFP.

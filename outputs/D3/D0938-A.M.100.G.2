The Milsteins own all but the lot on which St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church stood until it was crushed by 2 World Trade Center.
The planners of the trade center site originally envisioned that Block 56 would be part of the new Liberty Park, with St. Nicholas Church at its west end.
(Last week, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development approved the corporation's plan to spend $44.5 million to acquire the whole site, including the Milsteins "'" property.)

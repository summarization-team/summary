Last week, SCLC President Charles Steele told AJC reporters that the civil-rights organization would honor and recognize the embattled Falcon's quarterback who is under federal indictment on dog fighting charges.
And on Monday, shortly before former President Clinton was to address the convention, Stokes insisted that Steele never had any intention of honoring the quarterback, who is now banned from training with the team.
We need to support him no matter what the evidence reveals," Steele said before the convention began, adding that his organization was focusing on Vick's redemption.

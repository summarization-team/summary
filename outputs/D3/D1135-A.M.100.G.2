Among those recruiting investors on Madoff's behalf, the Times reported, were Japan's Nomura.
The New York Times reported that a hedge fund advisory firm, Fairfield Greenwich Group, had invested 7.5 billion dollars with Madoff.
Despite these and other red flags, hedge fund companies kept promoting Mr Madoff â€™ s funds to other funds and individuals," the Times wrote.

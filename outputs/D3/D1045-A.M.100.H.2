A top official with China's environmental watchdog said Thursday that the company overseeing a chemical plant where an explosion spewed lethal chemicals into a river in the country's northeast should be held responsible for the pollution.
It is the chemical plant of the CNPC in Jilin province."
The plant was run by the Jilin Petroleum and Chemical Company, which is under the state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. _ the country's largest oil company.
According to the official, observation data shows the degree of river water pollution has been declining.

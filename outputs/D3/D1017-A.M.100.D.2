Floyd ripped roofs off homes and flooded some streets in Eleuthera Island, which has a population of 10,000, Roach said.
NASSAU, Bahamas (AP)--Hurricane Floyd vented its fury on the Bahamas on Tuesday--toppling trees and power lines, stripping roofs off homes and shoving a roiling sea into streets.
The hurricane had turned to the northwest and was moving at 12 mph, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
Floyd's top sustained wind eased today to 140 mph--down from Monday's 155 mph but still a Category 4 storm, the second most powerful designation for a hurricane.

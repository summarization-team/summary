The US Supreme Court on Tuesday abolished the death penalty for those convicted of crimes they committed as minors.
The US high court upheld an earlier ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court banning the execution of those convicted of crimes they committed before turning 18.
The court had ruled in 1988 that the execution of offenders who were younger than 16 when they committed their crimes was unconstitutional, but a few US states continued to execute perpetrators who committed crimes at 16 or 17.

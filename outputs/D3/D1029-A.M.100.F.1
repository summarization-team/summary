Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged in January after rebels launched a deadly rocket barrage on a major gas plant in revenge for the rape of a female doctor.
Renegade tribesmen have surrounded some 300 soldiers, government officials and their families sheltering at a paramilitary fort in the town of Dera Bugti, some 245 kilometres (152 miles) southeast of Quetta, since Sunday.

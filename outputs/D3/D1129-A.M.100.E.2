In previous work, we have shown that survival rates for (prostate, breast, colon and lung) cancers improve when the diagnosis coincides with the season of maximum sun exposure, indicating a positive role for sun-induced vitamin D in prognosis - or at least that a good vitamin-D status is advantageous when combined with standard cancer therapies," said Richard Setlow, a biophysicist and one of the paper's authors.
The study found that Vitamin D levels, which were calculated based on sun exposure, correlated with better survival rates for cancer victims.

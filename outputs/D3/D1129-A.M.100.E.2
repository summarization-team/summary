The colorectal cancer research, published online in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, analyzed five studies on 1,448 individuals that explored the association of blood levels of vitamin D with colon cancer risk.
A high blood level of vitamin D could help reduce the risk of breast cancer by half and of colorectal cancer by two-thirds, the studies found.
The serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained by taking 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily plus, when the weather permits, spending 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun," he said.

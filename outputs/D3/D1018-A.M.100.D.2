Dickinson-based Texas EquuSearch will arrive Wednesday with 17 volunteers, including three search-and-rescue divers to look for 18-year-old Natalee Holloway, said volunteer diver Joe Huston in a telephone interview from Houston, Texas.
The group also will bring infrared cameras to search at night, Huston said.
A volunteer Texas rescue group said Tuesday it will bring special dogs and sonar equipment to Aruba to help search for a missing U.S. teenager more than three weeks after she disappeared.

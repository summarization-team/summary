We are worried about an ecological disaster ,"said Kim Jong-Sik, an official with the ministry of maritime affairs and fisheries, adding:``This is the country's worst oil spill.
A tanker spilled more than 10,000 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea after it was holed by a barge Friday in what officials said was South Korea's worst ever oil spill.
One of the worst oil spillages in the world from a tanker was in 1978, when the Amoco Cadiz spewed 220,000 tons off the coast of northwest France.

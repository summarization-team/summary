And only now, after an identity theft ring purchased two vehicles, obtained bank loans and opened numerous credit accounts at stores using her and her husband's identity, Mitchell said the full extent of the damage to her financial well-being is "n't" known.
Identity theft occurs when someone hijacks a consumer's personal identifying information such as a name, address, credit card or Social Security number and uses the information to open new charge accounts or purchase merchandise.
Though a suspect was arrested, Mitchell said neither she nor authorities know exactly how her personal information was compromised.

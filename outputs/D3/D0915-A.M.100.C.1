US commanders have warned of suicide attacks, car bombs and mortar and rocket fire on Iraq's first free election in half-a-century as insurgents try to wreck the milestone event.
A suicide bomber killed one person and wounded four others near a polling centre in Baghdad's upmarket Mansur district Sunday as Iraq's historic vote unfolded, the interior ministry said.
In the southern city of Basra, a mortar shell landed near a polling station but there were no reports of casualties.

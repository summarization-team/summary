NEW YORK (AP)--Four white police officers were charged with murder Wednesday for killing an unarmed African immigrant in a hail of 41 bullets--a shooting that has led to months of protests and a painful examination of police tactics and race relations.
In the two months since Diallo was killed, 1,203 people have been arrested in demonstrations over Diallo's death, the alleged police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the perception that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search tactics.

Toronto-based Menu Foods last week recalled millions of boxes of food, warning that some of its dog and cat food products sold under various brands in the United States, Canada and Mexico, could cause serious kidney problems.
Certain Menu Foods failed to implement quality assurance procedures and failed to adequately test the dog and cat food prior to introducing it into the Canadian market," the statement said.
If Menu Foods properly tested its food, my cat would not be seriously ill."

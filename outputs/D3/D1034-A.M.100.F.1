Of the 5,743 known species of toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and worm like amphibians, 1,856 (32.5 percent) are under threat, according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries.
Climate changes and pollution have been blamed for some of the disappearing species, according to the study published by Science magazine Friday.
Among the species, 122 have completely disappeared since 1980 and scientists fear that hundreds more will become extinct in coming decades.

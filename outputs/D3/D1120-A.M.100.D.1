I think a reasonably savvy person would have to say you "'re" going to see less water in that river ,"said Brad Udall, director of Western Water Assessment at the University of Colorado in Boulder, who was not a member of the report committee.
Scientists have concluded that the Colorado river system, which supplies water to 25 million people and several million acres of crop and ranch land, has been drier and more prone to severe drought than was the case in the early 20th century, when the river's flows were divvied among the seven basin states.

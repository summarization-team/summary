A federal investigation is focusing on wheat gluten as the likely source of contamination that sparked a recall last Friday of 60 million cans and pouches of the suspect food, said Stephen F. Sundlof, the Food and Drug Administration's top veterinarian.
During those tests, the company fed its product to 40 to 50 dogs and cats and some seven animals--the mix of species was not immediately known--died, Sundlof said.

South Korean television and newspapers have released what they called a taped private conversation between ambassador Hong Seok-Hyun and a top official of the country's largest conglomerate Samsung in 1997.
President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by businesses to politicians during the presidential poll in 2002.

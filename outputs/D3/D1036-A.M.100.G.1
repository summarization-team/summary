Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
The SBU chief and his deputy were present during the last business dinner (on September 5), but...I do "n't" say that I am directly blaming, or directly suspect these people of my poisoning," Yushchenko told reporters in the eastern city of Kharkiv.

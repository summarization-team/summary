A blood bank can also simplify the process of breeding pandas because data on the pandas "'" blood types and DNA information will be readily available to bring more diversity to the gene pool.
Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources said.
To boost their blood, researchers currently give pandas injections of glucose and medicine, but blood transfusions are more effective in helping the animals improve their immunity and accelerate the process of recovery.

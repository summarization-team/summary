Britain expects an``imminent"statement from the IRA as to whether the Northern Irish paramilitary group is to agree to an appeal from its political wing to abandon violence, a government minister said Monday.
The comments from Northern Ireland Minister Peter Hain--who said the IRA statement could``open a new chapter"for the British-ruled region--came as it was announced that Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern would meet in London this week.

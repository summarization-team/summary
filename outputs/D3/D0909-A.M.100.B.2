In April, Gerry Adams, the leader of the political wing of the IRA, Sinn Fein, made a direct appeal to the Roman Catholic paramilitary group to embrace purely political and democratic activity.
Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrat Party, the junior partner in Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's ruling coalition, said she hoped the IRA statement would see an end to "criminality in Ireland in all its forms once and for all".

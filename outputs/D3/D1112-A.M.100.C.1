A man found guilty of murder for causing a Los Angeles train crash that left 11 people dead should be jailed for life without parole, a jury recommended on Tuesday.
Defense lawyers claimed however that Alvarez had parked his car on the tracks to commit suicide but was unable to remove it after he changed his mind at the last minute.
Alvarez's car was hit by a Los Angeles-bound train, which derailed and then ploughed into a train travelling in the opposite direction.

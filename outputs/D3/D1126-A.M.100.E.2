A reporter who threw his shoes at President George W. Bush during a visit to Baghdad was an isolated attention-seeker who ignored Washington's good work in Iraq, a State Department official said Monday.
If you look at what we have done over the last several years with regard to improving the security situation in Iraq and in terms of helping Iraq along the path of democracy; if you look at how President Bush was welcomed by Prime Minister Maliki and others in the Iraqi government, I think it says a lot," he said.

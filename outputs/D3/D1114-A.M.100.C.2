We developed, validated and demonstrated highly improved accuracy of two clinical algorithms for global cardiovascular risk prediction that reclassified 40 percent to 50 percent of women at intermediate risk into higher or lower-risk categories," wrote the authors, including doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who developed the new approach.
US researchers have come up with a more accurate model to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease among women older than 45 that could improve prevention efforts, according to a study published on Tuesday.

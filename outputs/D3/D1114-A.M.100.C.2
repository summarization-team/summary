The study says that measuring the length of telomeres in middle- aged men could help pinpoint those most at risk of heart disease and direct them to statin treatment.
The researchers found that in the placebo group, the risk of heart disease was almost double among the men with short telomeres compared with counterparts with long telomeres.
The 484 men who went on to develop coronary heart disease had shorter telomeres than the 1,058 men who remained disease-free, the investigators discovered.

WASHINGTON (AP)--An E. coli outbreak that sickened at least 6 people visiting a Maine ski resort has been traced to contaminated ground beef produced at a Minnesota meat processing plant, authorities said Monday.
We have genetic fingerprints that link E. coli 0157: H7 in samples of the meat from Rochester Meats to the patients in Maine who have become ill," said Beth Gaston, spokesman for the Agriculture Department's food safety and inspection office.

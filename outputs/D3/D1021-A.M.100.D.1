After the victim's family voiced concerns that forcing him to testify against the teacher amid intense media attention would be traumatizing, LaFave's lawyers and prosecutors reached a deal in which she would avoid prison while accepting a sentence of three years of partial house arrest and seven years of conditional release.
The attractive blonde, blue-eyed teacher, Debra LaFave, 25, had earlier admitted to having had sex with her student several times in 2004, including in a mobile classroom where she taught and twice inside a car driven by the victim's older brother, who was only 15.

The tapes, broadcast over local television, recorded LaFave, 24, arranging an encounter with the youth, while expressing concern that he not lie to his mother, Tampa prosecutors said.
Prosecutors released photographs taken in a department store where they said the teacher had taken the youth, supposedly the day his relatives began to suspect that there was something between the two.
LaFave was accused of lewd acts with a child in several sexual encounters in the Hillsborough County school, in her car, and in the house that she had with her husband, in neighboring Ocala County.

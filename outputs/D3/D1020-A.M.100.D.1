WASHINGTON (AP)--A Canadian packing plant of IBP Inc. voluntarily recalled 46,000 pounds of ground beef products Saturday because of possible contamination with E. coli 0157: H7, the second recall in two days for the United States "'" largest beef processor.
In a release, the Lakeside plant said most of the beef was to have been processed by grocers or restaurants before being sold to consumers, which means no brand names or product codes are available for home checks.

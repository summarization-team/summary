The Japanese government faces an uphill battle to meet its target under the Kyoto Protocol of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions six percent by 2008-2012 from the 1990 level.
Japan announced a draft plan Monday to stop retailers from giving out plastic bags for free amid efforts to improve the environment in the nation where the landmark Kyoto Protocol was sealed.
If everything goes as scheduled, the bill to ban free distribution of plastic bags will be sent to the parliament in 2006 at the earliest," an environment ministry official said.

Usually sunny southern California has been whipped the past few days by storms that have killed at least two and caused floods, mudslides, power blackouts and deadly traffic accidents.
A man died and another was injured in Los Angeles "'" Elysian Park when a hillside collapsed and buried the two in the tent in which they were sleeping on Saturday night, officials said.
Residents of Santa Clarita had to be evacuated due to floods while the Coldwater Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles was strewn with fallen trees.

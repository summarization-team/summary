As hailstones hit central Los Angeles, parts of nearby cities of Hunting Beach, Long Beach and Glendale were turned into lakes, leaving homes drenched and caked in layers of mud as a monster storm system hammered usually-parched southern California, wreaking havoc across the region.
And on Monday, a 63-year-old man died when he was buried in about 1.2 meters (four feet) of mud that slid into his home in the Woodland Hills area of the Los Angeles, said Melissa Kelley of the Los Angeles Fire Department.

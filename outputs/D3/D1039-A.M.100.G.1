Seven people close to Islamic groups in The Netherlands are to be charged with terrorist-related activities over the murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh, the Amsterdam public prosecutor said on Friday.
Dutch police arrested six people, all of Moroccan or Algerian origin, after the killing of Van Gogh, who was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street.
Those to be charged included the alleged killer of Van Gogh, who has dual Dutch and Moroccan citizenship, said prosecutor Leo de Wit.

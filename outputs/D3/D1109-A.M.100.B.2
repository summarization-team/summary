The Palestinian Authority condemns the Israeli operation in Qabatiya during which two citizens were killed by the Israeli army, just as it condemns the attack that targeted civilians in a Dimona shopping centre," it said.
The Palestinian Authority led by president Mahmud Abbas condemned Monday's suicide attack in southern Israel that left one woman dead, the first such attack in a year.
An Israeli civilian woman was killed and 11 other people were wounded in Monday's blast.

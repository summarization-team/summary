Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., who as chief of naval operations in the early 1970s ordered the Navy to end racial discrimination and demeaning restrictions on sailors, then faced a haunting personal tragedy that he related to ordering the deployment of the defoliate Agent Orange in Vietnam, died Sunday at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.

The turtles, which can live for 80 years and weigh more than 300 kilograms (650 pounds) face growing threats, including becoming trapped in fishing nets and resort development on beaches where they lay their eggs.
The 1 meter (3.3 feet) -long female turtles, named Chandni III and Chandni IV, may have been hit by boats or somehow lost their transmitters, which only emit a signal when the animal comes up for air, they said.

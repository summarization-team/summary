Opposition leaders on Monday held Lebanese and Syrian governments responsible for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, demanded Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon within the next three months and called on the international community to intervene to help "this captive nation."
Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
We call upon the international community to shoulder its responsibility toward Lebanon, the captive nation," said the statement, read by legislator Bassem Sabei, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc.

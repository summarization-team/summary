It said the decision was taken after a family meeting Wednesday that came at the end of the mourning period and was attended by Hariri's wife and their seven children.
The statement said Hariri's wife, Nazek, would assume responsibility for the social and charity arm of Hariri's institutions.
The family of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri announced Wednesday that his second eldest son, Saad, would assume the political mantle left by the slain leader.

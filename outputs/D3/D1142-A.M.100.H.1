There were no further leads on who may have been responsible for the Tuesday evening bombings, eight explosions in all, according to A.S. Gill, director general of police for Rajasthan state, of which Jaipur is the capital.
Although Jaipur, known as the pink city, is a popular tourist destination, mid-May, the peak of the Indian summer, is not a busy season, and no foreigners were killed or injured in the blast, according to police and hospital officials here.

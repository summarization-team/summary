Ben Galati, a 54-year-old doorman a high-rise apartment tower across the street, said he was in the basement when it happened, and ran for his life when he heard the structure smash into his building.
About 19 of the 44 stories of the crane had been erected and it was to be extended Saturday, when a piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding it to the building, said Stephen Kaplan, an owner of Reliance Construction Group, which manages construction at the site.

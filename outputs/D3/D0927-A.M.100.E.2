Jennings, who announced in April that he had lung cancer, died Sunday at his New York home, ABC News President David Westin said in a statement.
His father, Charles Jennings, was the first person to anchor a nightly national news program in Canada and later became head of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s news division.
Jennings was picked to anchor the evening news and debuted on Feb. 1, 1965.
Jennings, ABC's chief news anchor for more than 20 years, was also "famously attracted to women," Koppel said.

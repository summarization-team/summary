Lawyers for L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's former CEO, and Mark H. Swartz, the company's former finance chief, suggested that former chairman John F. Fort and other directors knew about _ but did not protest _ money the executives received.
He said Mark Foley, Tyco's director of financial operations, never told him Kozlowski and Swartz had a total of $37.5 million in loans from Tyco in 1999.

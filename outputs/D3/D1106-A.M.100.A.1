Representatives from the commercial fishing industry, environmental groups and government regulators are discussing ways to strengthen information sharing and cooperation among regional organizations to track and manage tuna stocks.
By 2004, for example, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of the 1975 level in the western half of the ocean, according to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
The plan was approved in principle by the five global regulatory bodies meeting in the western city of Kobe, Kyodo News agency reported Thursday, citing unidentified conference officials.

The Indian navy action could hamper the pirates in the Gulf of Aden but the group holding the Sirius Star operates from mother ships further south.
An Indian warship destroyed a pirate "mother vessel" in the Gulf of Aden, the navy said Wednesday, as bandits demanded a ransom for a Saudi super-tanker seized in the most daring sea raid yet.
It was the first time a mother ship had been destroyed, in the most significant blow to pirates to date.

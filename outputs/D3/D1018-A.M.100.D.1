Dickinson-based Texas EquuSearch will arrive Wednesday with 17 volunteers, including three search-and-rescue divers to look for 18-year-old Natalee Holloway, said volunteer diver Joe Huston in a telephone interview from Houston, Texas.
Holloway Twitty was distributing prayer cards for her daughter around the island Tuesday when she found herself in Noord, a town in northwestern Aruba where van der Sloots "'" parents, justice official Paul van der Sloot and his wife, Anita van der Sloot, live.

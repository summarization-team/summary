Sri Lanka may be the country with the highest number of endemic frog species, but it has also seen the fastest die-off, he said.
According to the World Conservation Union, 19 of the 34 amphibian species identified as extinct worldwide are from Sri Lanka, Pethiyagoda said.
Conservationists in Sri Lanka, the world's top spot for frogs, have discovered 35 new species of the amphibians--only to find that another 19 species have died out.
Our discovery of new species underlined the importance of saving the pristine forests of Papua.

Aaron Harang allowed only one single in 6 1-3 innings and "D'Angelo" Jimenez had a pinch two-run double in the Cincinnati Reds "'" 6-1 victory for a three-game sweep of the New York Mets on Thursday.
Harang completed the sweep with one of the best performances of his career, allowing only three walks and Ramon Castro's second-inning single before letting the bullpen take over.
Washington, which moved during the offseason after 36 years as the Montreal Expos, completed its first series by winning two of three.

Premier Foods has found itself at the centre of a potentially damaging cancer scare after using in its products chilli powder contaminated with Sudan 1--an illegal red dye used for colouring non-edible items such as gasoline and shoe polish.
The Sudan 1 issue has been an upheaval for the business in terms of time and effort," Premier Foods chief executive Robert Schofield said as the company unveiled pre-tax profits of 8.7 million pounds (12.7 million euros, 16.6 million dollars) in 2004 compared with a loss of 300,000 pounds a year earlier.

Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has not allowed the United States or the IAEA to interrogate Khan directly, but the United States has submitted questions to him asking whether North Korea and Iran sold nuclear equipment to third parties, Time said.
The United States is investigating whether Pakistani scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and other countries, Time magazine reported Sunday.
Members of Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment, which worked closely with Khan in his role as the government's top nuclear scientist, are known to sympathize with Osama bin Laden," the magazine said.

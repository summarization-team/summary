A Canadian judge on
Wednesday acquitted two Sikh men accused of murdering 329 people in
an Air India jet bombing off the coast of Ireland in 1985.
Despite the horrific nature of the alleged crimes, there can be no lowering of the standard of proof from that required in any criminal trial," said Justice Ian Bruce Josephson in the British Columbia Supreme Court.
Bagri, a free man for the first time in four years, told reporters outside court that he had been accused of horrendous crimes.

Israeli radio reported that the blast was likely an attack, with an Israeli foreign ministry saying it could have been a car bomb attack, although the Egyptian public TV had earlier said the blast was due to a gas leak.
Shortly after the hotel blast, a second explosion was heard in the Sinai desert region of Nuaiba, between the Red Sea resorts of Taba and Sharm el-Sheikh, an Egyptian police source said.
At least 23 Israelis were killed in the blast, Egyptian police said.
Egyptian police said two other explosions rocked nearby tourist camps further south in the Sinai peninsula.

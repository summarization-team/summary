The study, one of the largest ever carried out into the contraceptive habits of Portuguese women, also found 16 percent of all sexually active girls in this age group do not use any form of birth control at all, the paper said.
The study was carried out by the association among 3,858 women between the ages of 15 and 49, the paper said.
Yet fully 83.4 percent of 15-to-19-year-old women said they had received information on contraceptives at school, according to the study by the Portuguese Society of Gynecology.

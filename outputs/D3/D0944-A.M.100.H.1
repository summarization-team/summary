The Supreme Court was considering the case of Christopher Simmons, who was condemned to death for the 1993 murder in Missouri of a woman who was abducted, tied up and thrown to her death from a bridge.
The court had ruled in 1988 that the execution of offenders who were younger than 16 when they committed their crimes was unconstitutional, but a few US states continued to execute perpetrators who committed crimes at 16 or 17.

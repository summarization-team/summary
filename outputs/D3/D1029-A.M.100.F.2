Gunbattles between the renegade clansmen and troops from Pakistan's Frontier Corps continued throughout the day after the attack in Baluchistan province, corps chief Major General Shujjat Zamir Dar told reporters.
Tribal rebels attacked a paramilitary convoy in restive southwest Pakistan on Thursday, killing three soldiers and injuring seven others, a senior military officer said.
Earlier corps spokesman Colonel Rizwan Malik said the tribesmen used light and heavy weapons and also rained more than 150 rockets and mortar shells on a nearby military base.

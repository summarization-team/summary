Disney and the government have so far refused to reveal the park's daily attendance figures.
Hong Kong's Disney theme park has drawn much lower than expected visitors in the two months since opening, a press report said Monday.
The park failed to attract the crowds despite introducing a discounted price for Hong Kong residents from November 8 to December 8, the report said.
The government also refused to reveal the park's daily attendance figures although rail operator MTR Corp has said the Disneyland Resort line carries 10,000 people on weekdays and 20,000 on Sundays.

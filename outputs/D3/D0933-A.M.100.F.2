How well you sleep could depend on who your parents were, researchers at Switzerland's Lausanne University reported on Thursday after identifying for the first time a "normal sleep" gene among mice.
Research on the mice found too much vitamin A was bad for sleep, although the scientists are unsure what the results of a deficiency of the vitamin would be and what the ideal intake is.
These so-called delta waves, the result of neuron activity, are telltales of the depth and quality of sleep.

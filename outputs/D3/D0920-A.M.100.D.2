A BA spokesman said there was "no threat to the security of the aircraft and we took the decision to return to Heathrow."
The Boeing 747, with 239 passengers aboard, was half-way to its destination when it decided to return to Heathrow Airport at 1115 GMT "because of a passenger that the American authorities did "n't" want to land in New York," said a BA spokesman.

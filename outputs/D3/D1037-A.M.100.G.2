Relyea said.
Relyea's company, Frank H. Flower & amp; Sons, is now the only oyster company remaining on Oyster Bay, and accounts for 90 percent of all oysters harvested statewide annually, Relyea said.
That's because the National Marine Fisheries Service is considering adding the Eastern oyster to the federal list of threatened or endangered species, a move that could devastate oystermen like Relyea.

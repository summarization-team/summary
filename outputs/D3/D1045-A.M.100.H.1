The 80-kilometer-long (50-mile-long) swathe of chemicals moved downstream into Harbin, a city of 3.8 million people in neighboring Heilongjiang province, on Thursday, prompting officials to shut down water supplies.
A top official with China's environmental watchdog said Thursday that the company overseeing a chemical plant where an explosion spewed lethal chemicals into a river in the country's northeast should be held responsible for the pollution.
We will be very clear about who's responsible," Zhang Lijun, deputy director of the State Environmental Protection Administration, said at a press conference.

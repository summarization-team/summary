Australia strongly opposes Japanese plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
Ruddock said Australia was``vigorously opposed"to the Japanese proposals and would press its efforts to establish a South Pacific whale sanctuary.
But the government opposes an application in Australia's Federal Court to prevent a Japanese whaling company entering the Australian-declared whale sanctuary in Antarctica, which Japan does not recognise.

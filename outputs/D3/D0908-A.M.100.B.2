We have real concerns about the steps back from democracy that have been taken in Nepal," said spokesman Scott McClellan.
The White House said Monday that it had "real concerns" about over the February 1 power grab by Nepal's King Gyanendra and urged him to enact democratic reforms.
We urge everybody to continue to move forward on democratic reforms, and that includes the government of Nepal.
Nine UN human rights experts on Tuesday expressed deep concern at King Gyanendra's seizure of power in Nepal last week and called for the restoration of democracy.

MACAO, January 4 (Xinhua)--Macao is fully prepared for any possible outbreak of the bird flu although no case of H5N1 virus has been found so far, a doctor with the Government Hospital said.
The doctor was quoted by the Tai Chung Po newspaper on Sunday that his hospital is fully prepared to cope with the treatment and testing of the bird flu disease which had killed four people in Hong Kong.
Although doctors have repeatedly called on local residents to remain calm, sales of chickens in Macao have plummeted by more than 50 percent over the past month.

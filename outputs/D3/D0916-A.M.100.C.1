On Tuesday, Al-Jazeera television showed a videotape of Jill Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who issued an execution ultimatum saying the US reporter would be executed within 72 hours if Iraqi women detainees were not set free.
Six Iraqi women detainees are to be freed soon following a review of their case, a justice ministry official said Wednesday, as the captors of a US woman journalist demanded all female prisoners be freed.
We asked that they either be charged or freed, and no proof has been found to implicate them in acts of violence," the official said.

Becoming the first senior officer fired over the poor treatment of wounded soldiers, Major General George Weightman "was informed this morning that the senior army leadership had lost trust and confidence in the commander's leadership abilities to address needed solutions for soldier-outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center," the army said in a statement.
I endorse the decision by Secretary of the Army Fran Harvey to relieve the commander of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center," Gates said in a statement, saying the wounded deserved "the highest standard of excellence."

Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, the first of 29 suspects to take the stand in the trial of the 2004 Madrid train bombings which opened Thursday, is considered by Spanish prosecutors to be one of four masterminds of the deadly attacks.
Nicknamed "Mohammed the Egyptian", the 35-year-old allegedly admitted being the organizer of the biggest terrorist attack in Spanish history in telephone conversations that were intercepted by police in Italy.

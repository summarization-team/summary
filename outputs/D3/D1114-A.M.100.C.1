British doctors measured the length of telomeres in the chromosomes of white blood cells among men aged 45-64 who had enrolled in a big study on coronary prevention in western Scotland.
The study says that measuring the length of telomeres in middle- aged men could help pinpoint those most at risk of heart disease and direct them to statin treatment.
Telomeres--nubby strips of DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes--predict a man's risk of developing heart disease, according to study published in Saturday's issue of The Lancet.

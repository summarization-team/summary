In a study released Monday, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and in Athens reported that Greeks who took regular 30-minute naps were 37 percent less likely to die of heart disease over a six-year period than those who never napped.
But even if workplace napping is unlikely to become widespread in the United States, there is something to be learned from the siesta study, said Dr. Michael Irwin, a sleep specialist at UCLA's Semel Institute for Neuroscience.

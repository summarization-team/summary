From now on, instead of catering to sports hunters, the outfitting company will focus on eco-tourism, arranging travel packages for tourists who wish to watch and photograph bears and other animals, said Genovali.
Genovali said it was largely because of the commercial grizzly bear hunt, which brought foreign tourists to the province to bag trophies, that Raincoast decided to buy a guide out-fitter.
The hunt has long been contentious, with threatened boycotts by international tourist groups, a ban on imported grizzly bear parts by the European Union, and efforts by conservationists to stop sport hunting.

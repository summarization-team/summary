Mallipo, about 150 kilometers (95 miles) southwest of Seoul, is one of the hardest-hit areas from the oil spill, which occurred Friday when a crane-carrying barge slammed into a supertanker, punching holes and causing it to release 66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters; 2.7 million gallons) of oil into the ocean.

Lee Woo-Sung, an official at a crisis centre set up by the ministry, said the tanker was no longer leaking after spilling an estimated 10,500 tons, but clean- up crews would continue working overnight.
Authorities battled to contain the oil inside a boom some eight kilometres (five miles) long to prevent it damaging the coastline, as a fleet of 28 ships scattered dispersant chemicals or tried to pump up the spillage.

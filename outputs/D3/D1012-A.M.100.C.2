A Cypriot transport official had said Sunday the passengers and crew may have been dead before the plane crashed.
Searchers were still looking for three bodies, including the plane's German pilot, fire officials said.
At least half a dozen people aboard a Cypriot plane were alive when the jetliner carrying 121 people slammed into a hillside north of Athens, Athens "'" chief coroner said Monday after conducting the first autopsies from the crash.
Only 47 of the bodies were at the central Athens morgue, Cyprus Health Minister Andreas Gabrielides said outside the hospital complex.

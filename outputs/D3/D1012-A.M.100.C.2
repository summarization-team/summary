Sotiris Voutas, a cousin of one of the passengers on the plane, told Greece's Alpha television that he received a text message from the cousin on his mobile phone minutes before the crash.
Greek fire chief Christos Smetis said there were no survivors among the 115 passengers and six crew on board the plane.
Officials were also citing decompression in the cabin and cockpit as a possible cause, and said the plane's two black boxes had been located.

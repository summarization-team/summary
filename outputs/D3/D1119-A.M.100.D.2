The pediatricians who petitioned the FDA Thursday acknowledged that children's cold medicines were generally safe in recommended doses, but they said overdoses were common because many children were given more than one medicine, among other reasons.
Common children's cold and cough medicines are coming under scrutiny from federal drug regulators, who say the remedies and their recommended doses have not been studied enough in children, a newspaper reported.
Most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines have been insufficiently tested in children, said Ganley, the director of the FDA's office of nonprescription drug products.

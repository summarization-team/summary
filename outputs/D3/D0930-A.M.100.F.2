Sequestrators say carbon dioxide (CO2) would be captured using solvents, either before or after the fossil fuel is burned in the plant.
Taking out the CO2 from fuel is called``carbon neutral ,"in other words not adding further to emissions from that source.
But a more ambitious possibility is``carbon negative ,"or removing CO2 from the atmosphere.
The theory is that fossil fuel power stations, oil rigs and other energy burners would hold on to waste gases such as carbon dioxode and methane, rather than releasing them into the atmosphere.

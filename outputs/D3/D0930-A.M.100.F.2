UNESCO said the conference would also tackle questions of governance and climate change.
Experts from around the world gathered in Paris Tuesday for a UNESCO conference on oceans, coasts and islands where the focus will be on stemming the erosion of biodiversity and the depletion of fish stocks, the UN's science and education body said.
Climate change is expected to emerge as a major cause for the loss of biodiversity by the end of the century and to increase the vulnerability of coastal communities through erosion and flooding," it said.

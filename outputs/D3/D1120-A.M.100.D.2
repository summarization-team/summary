Changes in climate and strong demand for water could drain Lake Mead, the man-made reservoir in Nevada and Arizona that helps manage water for seven western U.S. states, triggering severe shortages across the region, scientists warn.
There is a 50 percent chance Lake Mead will run dry by 2021 and a 10 percent chance it will run out of usable water by 2014, if the region's drought deepens and water use climbs, the researchers said.

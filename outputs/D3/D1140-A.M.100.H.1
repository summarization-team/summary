On Wednesday, Fakhruddin Ahmed, the head of the country's military-backed interim government, toured by helicopter some of the flood-hit areas in the north and promised to help to the victims.
Six more people drowned in the hardest-hit northern districts of Sirajganj and Tangail late Wednesday, raising the flood death toll to 46, the Food and Disaster Management Ministry said.
The River Jamuna breached its banks this week, inundating much of Sirajganj, a small town 104 kilometers (64 miles) northwest of the national capital Dhaka.

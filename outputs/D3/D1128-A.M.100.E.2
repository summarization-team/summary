Taylor's family also accused the Special War Crimes Court in The Hague, where the ex-leader is imprisoned, of violating Taylor's right to privacy and right to legal professional privilege by installing a video surveillance camera to record conferences with his attorneys.
The family of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, facing charges of war crimes, said Friday that his lawyers have threatened to withdraw from the case, claiming a lack of time and resources.
At the same time, Taylor was said to be in good health in his cell at The Hague where he mostly reads the Bible.

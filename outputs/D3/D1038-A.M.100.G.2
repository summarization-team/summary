An area of two-to-four hectares (five to 10 acres) on the lava cap rose and fractured during the eruption, releasing glacial water and the column of steam, Major said.
This was small explosive eruption from the lava dome that lasted for 24 minutes and generated a plume that rose up to a height of just under 10,000 feet (3,000 meters),"said USGS volcano and hydrology expert John Major.
The history of this volcano suggests that this could be the opening salvo of more eruptions ,"he said adding that the small 1986 eruption was similar to the latest one.

The volcano ejected steam followed by "a small amount of ash" in an eruption that lasted some 10 minutes at 9:47am (1647 GMT), said Tim McBicker, a spokesman for the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Mount St. Helens spewed out more steam on Monday after new seismic tremors that led some experts to warn the volcano could explode at any time.
A tremor shook St. Helens early Sunday for 25 minutes, prompting scientists to warn of an imminent eruption two days after the volcano roared back to life.

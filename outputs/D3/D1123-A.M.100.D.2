Greek investigators sought Saturday to determine whether a far- left group with a record of brazen strikes against well-protected targets was behind an audacious rocket attack against the US embassy in Athens.
The group currently thought to be behind the Friday attack, Revolutionary Struggle, only appeared in 2003 but has already established a record for strikes against high-profile targets.
The police are investigating the credibility of a telephone call to a private security company from a person claiming to represent the far-left Revolutionary Struggle, currently Greece's most powerful extremist group.

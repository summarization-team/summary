In the run-up to the Athens 2004 Olympics, the Greek police succeeded in dismantling the country's two deadliest groups--November 17 and the People's Revolutionary Struggle (ELA)--which had combined for a quarter-century of assassinations and attacks on police, banks and foreign interest targets.
The previously unknown group drew blood with its first attack in 2003, injuring a police officer in two explosions at the Athens court complex where members of November 17 were on trial at the time.

Ten people were killed and more than 100 injured Wednesday when two commuter trains slammed into each other after one of them hit a car left on the lines by a suicidal man, police said.
Meanwhile the driver of the vehicle that sparked the incident was expected to be charged with murder, police said.
He exited the vehicle and stood by as a southbound Metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the train to derail and strike the northbound train ,"the police chief said.

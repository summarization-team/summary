A man died and another was injured in Los Angeles "'" Elysian Park when a hillside collapsed and buried the two in the tent in which they were sleeping on Saturday night, officials said.
About 12,000 Los Angeles residents were without power, officials said.
Hundreds of cars were stranded in the snow in San Bernardino National Forest, east of Los Angeles.
Rescue workers used snowplows, snowcats and snowmobiles to free people from a 6-mile stretch of California Highway 18 in the San Bernardino Mountains after a combination of snow, rain, sleet and fog created a 200-vehicle logjam.

As a herd of elephants swooped on Joyariyanala village near a forest in southeastern Cox's Bazar district, Mohammed Mostafa, 9, and Lucky Akter, 7, fell victim on Wednesday night, the daily quoted police and forest officials as saying.
Wild elephants killed about 10 people in Cox's Bazar last year, a forest official said, adding that massive deforestation and encroachment due to fresh human settlements are destroying wildlife sanctuaries, which causes the elephants "'" more frequent intrusions into the villages.
Wild elephants straying into a village have trampled two children to death in southeastern Bangladesh, The Daily Star reported Thursday.

Judge Jeffrey A. Donnell moved the start of the trial for Russell Arthur Henderson from March 22 to April 6 due to a scheduling conflict involving one of the attorneys.
( AP )--The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
Henderson and Aaron James McKinney, both 21, are charged with murder and face the death penalty if convicted.
Shepard died following a brutal beating near Laramie in October that police said was motivated in part because he was gay.

Now with Rita approaching, more than 58 percent of crude oil drilling and about 35 percent of natural gas production has been suspended, according to US government figures Tuesday.
Oil prices were higher in Asian trade Wednesday as Hurricane Rita pounded the Florida Keys islands before barreling into the Gulf of Mexico where much of US production is sourced, dealers said.
Rita, expected to become a major storm, was tracking a path that could roughly follow that of Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico where about one-quarter of US oil operations are based.

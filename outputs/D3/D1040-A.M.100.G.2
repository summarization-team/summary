The prosecution case depended heavily on the testimony of two retired stuntmen who said that Blake solicited them to kill Bakley.
Blake-Hurwitz, a psychology professor, said she immediately arranged for a friend to take Rosie to a pediatrician.
Blake-Hurwitz said that's what her ex-husband may have believed, but it was not her reason for the annulment.
Smith said all comments attributed to Cole McLarty about his father's contact with Blake regarding Bakley were correct.
The defense established on cross-examination of Smith that the story never said Blake asked Gary McLarty to kill Bakley.

The illegal shipment of some 1,500 pieces of coral and seashells was listed as manufactured goods when it arrived at the Buenos Aires port, customs officials said.
Argentine customs said Monday it had seized a valuable, five-ton shipment of endangered and protected coral and seashells from the Philippines that was destined for the black market in tourist haven Mar del Plata.
Argentine customs officials said they were considering donating the coral and shells to museums or environmental organizations for their preservation.

The California-based company named Lee Der Industrial Co. in the southeastern province of Guangdong as the factory involved in Mattel's recall of 1.5 million toys last week, the Wall Street Journal reported.
US toy company Mattel identified a factory in China involved in producing toys which were recalled in the United States over fears they were tainted with poisonous lead, a report said Wednesday.
Mattel said it was still carrying out an investigation about the recalled products but was no longer accepting shipments from the factory in Guangdong, the leading business daily reported.

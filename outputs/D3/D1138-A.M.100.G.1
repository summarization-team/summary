For a prisoner to actually have a benefit for giving up an organ violates every ethical value I "'m" aware of," said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center and chairman of the Institute of Medicine's committee on human subject research in prisoners.
Federal law, for example, prohibits inmates from entering clinical trials of drugs under development even if they have cancer or AIDS, because their confinement could cause them to make a decision they might not otherwise make.

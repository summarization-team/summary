The US Supreme Court on Wednesday was to review the displaying in public spaces of the Ten Commandments, the fundamental moral precepts of Judeo-Christian religions, in a case that could define the extent of separation of church and state in American society.
Following challenges to the use of public property for displaying the commandments in Texas and Kentucky, the court will decide under what conditions, if at all, such explicitly religious displays are permitted.

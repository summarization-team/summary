The study found that a sleep deficit built up over just five nights can significantly impair heart function.
The electrocardiograms revealed that all of the volunteers had a much faster heart beat and significantly less heart rate variability following the nights of sleep deprivation.
Chronic sleep deprivation can do more than leave you short- tempered: it can also stress your heart and raise your risk of cardiovascular disease and death, according to a study released Wednesday.

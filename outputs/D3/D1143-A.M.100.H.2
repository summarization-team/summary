Simpson was found guilty of robbery and kidnapping here Friday, 13 years to the day after the American football legend was acquitted of brutally murdering his ex-wife and her friend.
After a three-week trial, a Las Vegas jury deliberated for more than 13 hours on Friday on charges against Simpson and a friend arising from an incident at the Palace Station casino in September last year.
Simpson showed no emotion as he and co-defendant Clarence Stewart were found guilty on all charges, which could see both men facing a maximum life sentence.

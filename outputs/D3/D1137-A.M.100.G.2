The crane crashed the whole building.
Maureen Shey, who lives diagonal from the building where the crane collapsed, said she was on the phone laying on her bed when she saw the giant white crane heading straight for her windows.
About 19 of the 44 stories of the crane had been erected and it was to be extended Saturday, when a piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding it to the building, said Stephen Kaplan, an owner of Reliance Construction Group, which manages construction at the site.
Our bar is done ,"he said.

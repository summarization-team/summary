Seven people were killed over the weekend when a construction crane collapsed in New York, police said Monday, reporting the discovery of three more bodies in the rubble.
Reports said that the three included two construction workers and a tourist from Florida who was in New York for Saint Patrick's Day festivities.
Four construction workers were initially confirmed dead in Saturday's accident, which saw a 60-meter (200-foot) crane collapse and crush an entire residential building and damage several other properties.

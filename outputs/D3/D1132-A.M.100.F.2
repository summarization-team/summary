Anggoro said there were 297 Hawksbill turtles, 89 green sea turtles and one olive ridley turtle, all preserved with formalin.
The men were caught by a patrol boat last month with 387 turtles that appeared to have been plucked from waters off the East Kalimantan district of Berau and processed on board, said Danang Anggoro from the provincial Natural Conservation Office.
An Indonesian court is to try 23 Chinese men seized off the coast of Borneo allegedly trying to smuggle home hundreds of endangered turtles, killed and stuffed to be sold as souvenirs, an official said Wednesday.

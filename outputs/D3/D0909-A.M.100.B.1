Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrat Party, the junior partner in Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's ruling coalition, said she hoped the IRA statement would see an end to "criminality in Ireland in all its forms once and for all".
Protestant factions in Northern Ireland, particularly the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) led by veteran hardliner Ian Paisley, are adamant that there can be no lasting settlement without a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal activity and to decommission its weapons.

The comments from Northern Ireland Minister Peter Hain--who said the IRA statement could "open a new chapter" for the British-ruled region--came as it was announced that Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern would meet in London this week.
The IRA's alleged misdeeds were highlighted by a massive bank raid in Belfast in December, blamed by police on the group, as well as the murder of Robert McCartney, a Belfast man beaten and stabbed to death in a bar in what his relatives say was an attack carried out by IRA activists.

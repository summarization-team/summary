The``bird flu"has claimed four victims here, killing two, including a 54-year-old man who died Friday.
A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the``bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.
At least seven staff who had contact with the victims were experiencing flu-like symptoms, but it was not clear if they had also contracted the H5N1 strain, local health officials said today.

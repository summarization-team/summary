The embryonic stem cells were then transplanted into six cynomolgus monkeys, which had drug-induced symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease in humans.
Japanese researchers said Tuesday they had successfully treated monkeys with Parkinson's disease through a stem cell transplant, potentially paving the way for an ideal remedy to the intractable disease.
There are many approaches to curing the disease, such as strong drugs or destruction of troubled cells in the brain, but use of embryonic stem cells is seen as an ideal and fundamental therapy for the disease," he said.

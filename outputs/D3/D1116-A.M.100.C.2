Formally known as the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Virginia Tech was founded in 1872 as a land-grant school--a college or university designated at its founding by state or federal lawmakers to teach agriculture, military tactics, or the mechanical arts so that members of the working class could obtain a liberal, practical education.
The school, the largest university in Virginia, currently has some 25,000 full- time students on a campus encompassing more than 100 buildings and some 2,600 acres.

The gunman who killed at least 30 people at a US university this week was briefly taken to a mental health facility out of concerns he was suicidal in late 2005, police said Wednesday.
He did not know whether Cho, who killed himself after Monday's shooting rampage, was taken there voluntarly or involuntarily.
He was taken to St Albans outside Radford," Virginia, Virginia Tech police chief Wendell Flinchum told reporters.
Librescu became a senior researcher and mathematics lecturer at Virginia Tech University where he taught for 20 years.

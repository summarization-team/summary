Hunters, who can get up to 2,685 euros (3,500 dollars) for a bear pelt, had been killing around 250 bears a year before the first quota of 150 kills was introduced for 2006.
We have decided on this reduction in the 2007 quota to be more in line with a level suggested by biologists, who wanted an even lower number," a ministry of fisheries and hunting official, Ole Heinrich, told AFP.

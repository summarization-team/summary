The White House said Monday that it had "real concerns" about over the February 1 power grab by Nepal's King Gyanendra and urged him to enact democratic reforms.
Gyanendra, who controls the army, last week fired the government for failing to organise elections and for failing to end the Maoist insurgency, named a loyalist cabinet under his chairmanship, declared a state of emergency and pledged to restore multi-party democracy in three years.

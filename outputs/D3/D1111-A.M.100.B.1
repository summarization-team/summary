The rampage, which began at 11:43 am (0943 GMT) inside a classroom at the secondary school of some 450 pupils, came after Auvinen posted a video entitled "Jokela High School Massacre--11/7/2007" on file-sharing website YouTube.
Police identified the killer as 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen, who died from his injuries late Wednesday after shooting himself in the head following the massacre at Jokela High School in the small town of Tuusula.

Police said Auvinen killed eight people before turning the gun on himself in a shooting rampage Wednesday at Jokela High School in Tuusula, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the capital, Helsinki.
On Thursday, grieving students placed candles outside the school, which was still roped off by police tape as forensic experts sought to reconstruct the shooting spree that sent panicked students and teachers fleeing for their lives.
Investigators believe the killer, identified as 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen, revealed plans for the attack in postings on YouTube in which he urges revolution and grins after taking target practice.

A meeting Friday in Japan approved a world first international plan to save tuna from overfishing, including measures to monitor the animals "'" populations across regions, delegates said.
The meeting, the first to bring together the world's five tuna conservation bodies, concluded with an action plan drafted by some 60 countries or areas.
It was reached after five days of talks in the western Japanese city of Kobe.
The European Union--which has the largest quota--agreed to a 20.7 percent cut to 14,504 tonnes by 2010 from 18,301 tonnes in 2006, the Japanese Fisheries Agency said in a statement.

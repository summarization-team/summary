BOULDER, Colo. (AP)--JonBenet Ramsey's mother switched from charming to tough when challenged by a detective, leading police to believe she was "capable of bringing harm to her daughter," author Lawrence Schiller writes in a new book on the crime.
Schiller said an investigator found Patsy Ramsey to be charming and polite for the first two days of questioning in June.
The tougher the questions became, the tougher Patsy became...," Schiller said.
Arndt testified before the grand jury last fall but has remained publicly silent about her involvement in the case.

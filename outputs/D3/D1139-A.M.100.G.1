The U.S. Navy said the oil tanker MV Sirius Star was seized on Saturday about 520 miles (833 kilometers) southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, and that the bandits were taking the ship to a Somali port known as a hub of pirate activity.
The vessels have been dispatched to the region under a U.N. mandate to escort vessels chartered by the World Food Program to Somali ports, and to conduct patrols designed to deter pirates from attacking merchant ships transiting through the Gulf of Aden.

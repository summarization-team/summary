Police said seven blasts occurred within minutes of each other during the evening in crowded markets of old walled Jaipur, about 260 kilometres (160 miles) from New Delhi.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed for calm, while the United States immediately condemned the wave of bombings.
Press Trust of India, which said 200 had been injured, quoted a statement from Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani saying his country, "condemns all acts of terrorism and reaffirms its firm commitment to fight this scourge together with the international community."

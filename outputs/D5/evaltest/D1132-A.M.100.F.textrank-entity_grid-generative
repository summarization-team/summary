In Malaysia, 17 Chinese nationals were arrested for poaching 240 protected turtles, most of which were dead.
The poachers were caught off the coast of Sabah, with only 20 turtles found alive.
The Chinese fishermen received six-month sentences for poaching and encroaching on Malaysian waters.
This was the second group of Chinese fishermen caught for turtle poaching in the same week.
Despite the arrests, authorities expect more poachers due to the lucrative trade in endangered turtles.
In Thailand, a critically endangered turtle species thought to be extinct was discovered, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts.

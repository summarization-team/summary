A group of 17 Chinese nationals from Hainan were arrested for poaching 240 protected turtles in Malaysia's waters, with most of the turtles found dead.
The poachers received six-month sentences for each of three offenses.
Another group of 13 Chinese fishermen was jailed for 18 months for poaching nearly 80 turtles.
Despite the arrests, authorities expect more poachers due to the lucrative turtle trade.
In Thailand, a critically endangered turtle species was discovered after two decades, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts.
Conservationists stress the need to protect natural habitats to prevent further endangerment of species.

A tragic school shooting in Finland left eight dead, including classmates and the headmistress.
The shooter, a teenager, had posted a video online signaling his intentions.
Finnish Prime Minister Vanhanen called it a "great tragedy" that shattered society's sense of security.
The gunman, influenced by extreme ideologies, carried out the massacre alone before taking his own life.
Police found him with 500 bullets and a suicide note expressing anger towards society.
The incident, the worst in Finnish history, prompted condolences from the government and flags to be flown at half-mast.
It was a heartbreaking day that ended in senseless violence and loss.

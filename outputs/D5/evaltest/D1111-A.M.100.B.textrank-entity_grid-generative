A tragic school shooting in Finland left eight dead, including classmates and the headmistress.
The shooter, a teenager, had posted a video on YouTube prior to the rampage, causing shock and disbelief in society.
Finnish Prime Minister Vanhanen called it a "great tragedy."
The gunman, influenced by extremist ideologies, had expressed admiration for historical figures like Hitler and Stalin.
He was found with 500 bullets and a suicide note.
The incident, the worst in Finnish history, prompted the government to fly flags at half-mast and offer condolences to the victims' families.

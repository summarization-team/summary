Malaysia arrests more Chinese nationals for turtle poaching
China is a major importer of turtles from Asia for food and medicinal purposes and aggressive illegal poaching in Southeast Asian countries has seen sea turtle numbers falling.
Seventeen Chinese nationals in a wildlife poaching outfit have been caught with 240 protected turtles, most of them dead, in the second such seizure this week, police said Thursday.
The arrests follow a similar incident Monday off Sabah "'s" waters, where marine police detained 19 Chinese nationals from Hainan with 78 turtles, most of them dead as well.

Pirates have seized control of the Saudi-owned super tanker Sirius Star off the east coast of Africa and are taking it towards a Somali port, the US Navy said on Monday.
The 318,000 deadweight tonnes Very Large Crude Carrier is the largest vessel to be seized in an epidemic of piracy in the region.
According to the latest report we have, the ship is approaching the Somali coast, heading towards Eyl (port)," a spokeswoman for the Bahrain-based US Fifth Fleet told AFP by telephone from Dubai.
Can we assume that the pirates are Somalis?
Yes."

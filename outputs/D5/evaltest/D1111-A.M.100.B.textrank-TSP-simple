We heard the shots and then we broke the windows and jumped out," said Franz Andersin, a 14-year-old student who was in the school when the shooting spree started.
The shooting has deeply undermined the sense of security in society...Nobody had expected such things," Vanhanen said.
Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen described the shooting, the worst in the Nordic country's history, as "a great tragedy."
A teenager at a school in Finland went on the rampage Wednesday, shooting dead seven classmates and the headmistress, having first signalled his intentions in a video posted on the YouTube Internet site.

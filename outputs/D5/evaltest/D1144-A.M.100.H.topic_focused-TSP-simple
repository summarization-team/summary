The commission works with companies to issue recalls when it finds consumer goods that can be harmful.
Allmark said the recall was troubling because Fisher-Price has had a long-standing relationship with the Chinese vendor, which had applied decorative paint to the toys.
Toy-maker Fisher-Price is recalling 83 types of toys--including the popular Big Bird, Elmo, Dora and Diego characters--because their paint contains excessive amounts of lead.
The recall is the first for Fisher-Price Inc. and parent company Mattel Inc. involving lead paint.

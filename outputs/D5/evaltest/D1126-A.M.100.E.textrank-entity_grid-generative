US Defense Secretary Robert Gates declared the US mission in Iraq was in its "endgame."
During President George W. Bush's farewell visit, a journalist threw two shoes at him, symbolizing lingering hostility.
Despite signing a security pact with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Bush admitted more work remained.
The shoe-throwing incident, while chaotic, highlighted the mixed sentiments towards Bush's legacy in Iraq.
Bush, unperturbed, joked about the shoe size and downplayed the threat.
The unexpected act overshadowed Bush's attempt to emphasize progress in the war-torn nation before his term ended.

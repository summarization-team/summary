A study published in The Lancet revealed that measuring telomere length in middle-aged men could identify those at higher risk of heart disease.
Men with short telomeres benefited from statins, reducing heart disease risk.
Additionally, a gene variant predisposes women to heart disease, with those affected being more likely to develop coronary artery disease.
Gum disease has been linked to pancreatic cancer, while stress in childhood may impact heart disease risk later in life.
Air pollution poses a greater risk to postmenopausal women for cardiovascular disease.
The study emphasizes the importance of reducing air pollution to lower cardiovascular disease rates.

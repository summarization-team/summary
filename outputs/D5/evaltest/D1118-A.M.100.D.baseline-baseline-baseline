A teenager armed with a semi-automatic rifle opened fire on Christmas shoppers at an Omaha shopping mall, killing at least eight people before turning the gun on himself.
At least five other people were injured and taken to area hospitals after Wednesday's shooting inside the Westroads Mall, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren told reporters.
Two are reportedly in critical condition.
The shooting "appears to be very random and without provocation," Warren said late Wednesday, adding that police were still interviewing witnesses.
He identified the shooter as Robert Hawkins, 19, and said he was armed with an SKS assault rifle.

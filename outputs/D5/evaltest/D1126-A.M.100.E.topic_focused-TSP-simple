Bush has staunchly defended the invasion that triggered years of deadly insurgency and sectarian violence that has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis and more than 4,200 American troops.
Bush, on his fourth and final official trip to Iraq since he ordered the March 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam, admitted: "There is still more work to be done . "" "
On Saturday, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates visited Iraq and said that the US mission was in its "endgame . "" "

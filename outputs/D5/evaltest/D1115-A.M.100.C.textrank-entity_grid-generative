South Korea faced its worst oil spill when a tanker leaked over 10,000 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea after a collision with a barge.
Efforts to contain the spill involved a fleet of 28 ships using dispersant chemicals and booms.
Despite the leak being stopped, cleanup operations continued overnight to prevent further damage to marine farms.
The incident, which left the tanker with three holes, occurred off the west coast near Mallipo beach.
This spill, estimated to be the largest in South Korea's history, raised concerns about environmental impact and potential damage to the coastline.

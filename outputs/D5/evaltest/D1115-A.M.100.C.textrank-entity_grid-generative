South Korea faced its worst oil spill when a tanker leaked over 10,000 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea after a collision with a barge.
Efforts to contain the spill involved a fleet of 28 ships using dispersant chemicals and booms.
Despite the leak being stopped, cleanup crews continued working overnight to prevent further damage to the coastline.
The incident threatened marine farms in the region, with a slick of oil stretching five kilometers.
This disaster surpassed previous oil spills in South Korea, highlighting the urgent need for environmental protection measures.

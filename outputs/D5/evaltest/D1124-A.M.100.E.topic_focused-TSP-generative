An Indonesian minister claimed the mud volcano on Java was a natural disaster unrelated to his family's drilling activities.
The eruption, caused by gas drilling, has submerged villages and forced 13,000 to flee.
Attempts to stop the mud flow with concrete balls have failed, damaging the ecosystem and agricultural land.
President Yudhoyono ordered compensation, but the mud continues to spread.
Despite delays in plugging the crater, experts warn of the ongoing environmental impact.
An environmental group has sued the president and the energy firm over the disaster, seeking accountability for the displaced residents and damaged environment.

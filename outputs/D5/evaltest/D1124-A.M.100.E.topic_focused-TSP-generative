An Indonesian minister claimed the mud volcano was a natural disaster unrelated to drilling activities.
The eruption, caused by drilling for gas, has submerged villages and forced thousands to flee.
President Yudhoyono ordered compensation for the disaster.
Efforts to stop the mud flow, including dropping concrete balls into the volcano, have been unsuccessful.
The ecosystem has been destroyed, and experts struggle to redirect the mud.
Environmental groups have filed lawsuits against the drilling company and government officials.
The situation remains dire as the mud continues to spread, displacing more residents and damaging agricultural land.

An Indonesian minister claimed the mud volcano on Java was a natural disaster unrelated to drilling activities.
The eruption, named "Lusi," was likely triggered by gas drilling, not an earthquake.
Lapindo Brantas Inc. has been ordered to pay compensation for the disaster.
Efforts to stop the mud flow, like dropping concrete balls into the volcano, have been unsuccessful.
The ecosystem has suffered, with agricultural land destroyed.
Environmental groups have filed lawsuits against the drilling company and President Yudhoyono over the environmental damage and displacement caused by the mud flow.

a meeting in the western city of Kobe, japan, is set to adopt a first-of-a-kind global action plan .
the plan calls for a global tracking system to track tuna from the open sea to the fish market .
by 2004, the number of adult bluefin tuna capable of spawning had plummeted to 19 percent .
environmentalists say the global fad is bringing tuna numbers to the brink of extinction .

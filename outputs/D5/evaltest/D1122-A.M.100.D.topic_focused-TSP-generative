A bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed, causing at least six deaths and numerous vehicles to plunge into the water.
The incident, not linked to terrorism, led to a rescue operation with estimates of 50-100 cars in the river.
Despite structural concerns dating back to 1990, the bridge's collapse shocked officials.
President Bush pledged federal support for rebuilding efforts, as Governor Pawlenty ordered inspections of similar bridges.
The tragedy highlighted the need for infrastructure maintenance and raised questions about the safety of America's bridges.

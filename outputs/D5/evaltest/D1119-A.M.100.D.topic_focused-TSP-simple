Common children "'s" cold and cough medicines are coming under scrutiny from federal drug regulators, who say the remedies and their recommended doses have not been studied enough in children, a newspaper reported.
Most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines have been insufficiently tested in children, said Ganley, the director of the FDA "'s" office of nonprescription drug products.
The American College of Chest Physicians last year recommended avoiding using cough and cold medicines in children, especially young ones.

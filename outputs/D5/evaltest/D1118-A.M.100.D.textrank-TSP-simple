The Omaha World Herald reported that Hawkins had also been fired from his job at a McDonald's, and was arrested Friday for being a minor in possession of alcohol--the legal drinking age in the United States is 21.
The sheriff's office and Omaha police could not be immediately reached for comment.
The Sarpy County Sheriff's Department, located just south of Omaha in Papillion, told KETV that Hawkins "'" mother walked into its office shortly after the shooting with a note that "could be interpreted as suicidal."

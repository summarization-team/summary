There is huge potential for water saving in China," said Wang Shucheng, minister of water resources.
China only recycles 60 to 65 percent of its industrial water, compared with 80 to 85 percent in developed countries, the agency said.
China plans to cut its average water consumption by 20 percent by the end of 2010 in an effort to avert a looming shortage crisis, state media reported Thursday.

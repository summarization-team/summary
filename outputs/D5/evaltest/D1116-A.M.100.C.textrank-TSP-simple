Until Monday's shooting, the town was best-known for the university and its Blacksburg Electronic Village--one of the oldest Internet-based community networks in the United States.
The university dominates the life in the southwestern Virginia town of Blacksburg with its population of just 40,000, and the school's 900-million dollar budget drives the local economy.
The school, the largest university in Virginia, currently has some 25,000 full- time students on a campus encompassing more than 100 buildings and some 2,600 acres.

Many of Virginia Tech's students are pursuing undergraduate or graduate degrees in technical and applied studies such as computer science, agriculture, engineering, or business.
Virginia Tech also has a full-time military training program with a corps of cadets, one of the few in the country.
The university dominates the life in the southwestern Virginia town of Blacksburg with its population of just 40,000, and the school's 900-million dollar budget drives the local economy.

In May 2004, during the Athens Games, a new group set off bombs outside a police station.
The Greek police had previously dismantled two deadly groups, November 17 and ELA.
Revolutionary Struggle emerged in 2003, carrying out destructive strikes.
They targeted the US embassy in 2005 and 2007.
The US praised Greek authorities for their response to the attacks.
The recent rocket attack on the embassy raised concerns of a resurgence of militant groups.
Investigations are ongoing to identify and bring the perpetrators to justice.
The attack highlighted security vulnerabilities despite improvements since the dismantling of November 17.

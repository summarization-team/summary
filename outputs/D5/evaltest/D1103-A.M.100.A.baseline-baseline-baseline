Two members of Basque separatist group ETA arrested while transporting half a tonne of explosives to Madrid just prior to the March 2004 bombings Monday received jail sentences of 22 years each.
Prosecutors alleged Irkus Badillo and Gorka Vidal wanted to "sow panic" in Madrid after being caught in possession of 500 kilogrammes (1,100 pounds) of explosives, and had called on the high court to hand down 29-year sentences.
The two men were jailed for belonging to a terrorist group, conspiring to commit terrorist offences and illegally transporting explosives.

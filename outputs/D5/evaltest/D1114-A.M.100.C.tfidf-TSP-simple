The 484 men who went on to develop coronary heart disease had shorter telomeres than the 1,058 men who remained disease-free, the investigators discovered.
The researchers found that in the placebo group, the risk of heart disease was almost double among the men with short telomeres compared with counterparts with long telomeres.
Telomeres--nubby strips of DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes--predict a man's risk of developing heart disease, according to study published in Saturday's issue of The Lancet.

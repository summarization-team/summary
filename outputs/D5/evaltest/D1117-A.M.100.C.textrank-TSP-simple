The action followed an investigation by the Washington Post that found that seriously wounded service members treated as outpatients at Walter Reed lingered there virtually forgotten for 18 months or more because of bureaucratic snafus.

The Pentagon said reviews of medical care at the premier military hospitals, Walter Reed and the National Naval Medical Center, have been launched by the army and navy's respective civilian chiefs.

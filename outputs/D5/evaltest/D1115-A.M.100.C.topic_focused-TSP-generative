Several major oil spill incidents have caused significant environmental damage along coastlines.
In 1978, the Amoco Cadiz tanker spilled 220,000 tons off the coast of France, and in 1967, the Torrey Canyon tanker spilled 119,000 tons off Britain's Scilly Isles.
South Korea faced its worst oil spill in 2007 when a tanker leaked 15,000 tons of crude oil after a collision.
This surpassed the previous 1995 incident where 5,000 tons were spilled.
Efforts to contain the spill involved setting up booms and fences to prevent further damage to the coastline and marine life.

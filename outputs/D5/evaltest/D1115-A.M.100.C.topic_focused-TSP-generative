In a devastating incident, a Hong Kong-registered oil tanker collided with a vessel off South Korea's west coast, leaking 15,000 tons of crude oil.
This marked the country's worst oil spill, surpassing previous disasters.
Efforts to contain the spill were underway, with 66,000 barrels of oil spreading over a 7.4-kilometer area.
The environmental impact was a major concern, especially for the coastline near Mallipo beach, known for its scenic beauty and wildlife habitats.
This catastrophe echoed past tragedies, such as the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska, highlighting the urgent need for stricter maritime safety measures.

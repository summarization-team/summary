A team of US scientists has used DNA testing to identify the geographic origin of poached elephant tusks--research they hope may help curb the illegal ivory trade.
Resurgence of illicit trade in African elephant ivory is placing the elephant at renewed risk," the scientists said in a study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Regulation of this trade could be vastly improved by the ability to verify the geographic origin of tusks," they said.

Teen kills eight in US mall rampage
A teenager armed with a semi-automatic rifle opened fire on Christmas shoppers at an Omaha shopping mall, killing at least eight people before turning the gun on himself.
The woman was working at a store when she got a phone call from her angry boyfriend who threatened to harm her, local television station KHOU said.
The woman called mall security for help, but the boyfriend arrived before they did and took her hostage, pulling down the store "'s" front gate and barricading them inside.
Bush expressed sadness after learning about the shooting.

A plea agreement revealed on Monday with one of Michael Vick's federal dogfighting conspiracy co-defendants could give the American football star another hurdle in his upcoming legal fight.
Tony Taylor, among four men charged with organizing and staging dogfights across US state border lines, has changed his plea to guilty, ESPN and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
Taylor, 34, is scheduled to be sentenced on December 14.
Taylor said he would not receive any specific sentencing break based upon his deal to testify to authorities regarding people's roles in the conspiracy.

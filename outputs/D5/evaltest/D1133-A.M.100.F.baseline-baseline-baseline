A blazing car crashed into the terminal building at Glasgow Airport in Scotland on Saturday, police said.
The incident came just a day after police foiled car bomb attacks in London.
The police have been called at about 3:15 (pm) (1415 GMT) at Glasgow Airport.
A car had crashed inside the terminal.
It was on fire," a police spokeswoman told AFP.
She added that she did not know if it was a terrorist attack or if there were any victims.

The recent attack on the US embassy in Athens has raised concerns about the resurgence of far-left extremist groups in Greece.
Revolutionary Struggle, responsible for the attack, has a history of targeting symbols of imperialism and capitalism.
Despite improved security since the dismantling of November 17 and ELA, the attack has sparked fears of a return to extremist violence.
The US praised Greek authorities for their response, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance.
While no international links have been found, the incident serves as a reminder of the persistent threat posed by domestic terrorist groups in Greece.

The illegal ivory trade poses a significant threat to African elephants, with only 10% of contraband being detected.
Recent DNA testing has identified the origin of poached tusks, primarily from southern Africa.
The resurgence of illicit trade is pushing elephants towards extinction, prompting calls for stronger enforcement.
Countries like Kenya and Mali advocate for a complete ban on ivory trade, while others, like Tanzania, see controlled trading as a conservation tool.
The debate intensifies as conservationists stress the need for sustainable solutions to protect these majestic creatures from further harm.

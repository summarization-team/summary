The announcement of the number infections comes a day after Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang ordered an investigation into the microbicide clinical trials in the eastern KwaZulu Natal province.
The termination of the Ushercell trials is a setback for microbicide research," the TAC said in a statement.
South Africa's main anti-AIDS lobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) said the halting of microbicide trials was a "setback".
We are investigating whether these women were infected as a result of the use of the microbicide, Ushercell," added Mngadi.

In the lead-up to the Athens 2004 Olympics, Greek police dismantled the deadly groups November 17 and ELA, known for attacks on police, banks, and foreign interests.
A new group emerged in 2003, Revolutionary Struggle, carrying out destructive strikes.
In 2005, they targeted the home of former minister George Voulgarakis.
The US embassy in Athens was attacked in 2007, with Revolutionary Struggle claiming responsibility.
Despite improved security since November 17's breakup, concerns remain.
The attack, using a rocket-propelled grenade, caused damage but no injuries, prompting a joint US-Greek investigation.

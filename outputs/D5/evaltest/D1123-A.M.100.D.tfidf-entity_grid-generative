In the lead-up to the Athens 2004 Olympics, Greek police dismantled the deadliest groups, November 17 and ELA, known for attacks on various targets.
A new group emerged in 2003, Revolutionary Struggle, carrying out destructive strikes.
In 2005, they targeted the home of a former minister.
Following an attack on the US embassy in Athens, Italian and US officials condemned the violence.
The US praised Greek authorities for their response.
The attack, likely domestic terrorism, raised concerns of a resurgence in militant groups.
Investigations are ongoing to identify and bring the perpetrators to justice.

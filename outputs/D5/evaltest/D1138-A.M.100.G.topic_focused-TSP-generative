Russian lawmakers passed a law allowing local hospitals to perform organ transplants, previously limited to larger hospitals.
This change aims to address the issue of organ trafficking.
In Russia, serious cases are often transferred to central hospitals in major cities.
Concerns about organ trafficking extend beyond Russia, with reports of unethical practices in China.
The Philippines and Zimbabwe are also working to regulate organ donation programs.
In the US, legislation is being considered to incentivize organ donation among inmates.
Overall, there is a global push to improve organ donation regulations and practices.

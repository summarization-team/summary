Russian lawmakers passed a law allowing local hospitals to perform organ transplants, previously limited to larger hospitals.
This change aims to address the issue of organ trafficking, which has been a concern in Russia.
The law highlights the importance of regulating organ donation and transplant procedures.
In other countries like Canada and the Philippines, organ donation practices are also under scrutiny.
Meanwhile, in the US, there are discussions about incentivizing organ donation among inmates.
The focus is on improving organ transplant systems to save lives and prevent unethical practices.

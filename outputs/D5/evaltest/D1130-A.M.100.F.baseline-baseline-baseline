Indonesian navy ships on Monday renewed efforts to reach survivors of a ferry disaster who spent a third night on the open sea as continuing rough weather hindered the search for hundreds still missing.
Navy ships are still searching now.
We "'re" still trying the best we can," Central Java navy commander Colonel Yan Simamora told AFP.
Fishermen and search and rescue teams have thus far found around 200 survivors following the sinking of the ferry off the coast of Java late Friday with some 600 on board, officials said.

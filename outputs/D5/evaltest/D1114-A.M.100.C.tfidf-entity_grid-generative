A study in western Scotland found that measuring telomere length in middle-aged men can identify those at risk of heart disease.
Shorter telomeres were linked to a higher risk of coronary heart disease.
Additionally, a gene variant in women was associated with a higher risk of heart disease.
Other studies explored the connection between gum disease and pancreatic cancer, as well as the impact of air pollution on cardiovascular health.
These findings contribute to personalized medicine and highlight the importance of early risk identification for targeted interventions.

A gunman shot girls in the head "execution style" at an Amish school in Pennsylvania state on Monday, killing four and wounding at least six others, police and officials said.
The gunman, a local truck driver Charles Roberts, was apparently acting in "revenge" for an incident that happened to him 20 years ago.
Roberts killed himself in the one-room remote Amish schoolhouse before police could get to him, State Police Commissioner Jeffrey Miller told a press conference.
Miller confirmed three dead at the scene.

Juan Manuel Alvarez was convicted of causing a fatal train crash in Los Angeles.
Prosecutors argued he did it for attention, while defense claimed it was a suicide attempt gone wrong.
The jury recommended life in prison without parole, rejecting the death penalty.
Alvarez's actions were seen as a cry for help to his estranged wife.
His troubled past, including childhood abuse and mental illness, was highlighted in court.
Despite the tragic outcome, some believe Alvarez's intent was not to harm others but to end his own life.
The case remains a complex and emotional legal battle.

The family of former Liberian president Charles Taylor expressed concerns over the imbalance in legal representation, with the prosecution having more senior counsels than the defense.
They also criticized the installation of video surveillance in Taylor's meetings with his lawyers, hindering his ability to freely discuss his case.
Taylor's lawyers threatened to withdraw due to lack of resources and time, while also facing difficulties in securing witnesses.
The trial, set to begin in The Hague, has been marred by delays and funding issues, with the defense seeking more support to mount a proper defense.

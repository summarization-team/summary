Russ Knocke, spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told AFP that there was no suggestion of terrorism involved in the disaster.
Ramon Houge was driving on the bridge when he heard a rumbling noise, saw the ground collapse in front of him and watched cars go down into the water.
At least six people were killed after a bridge over the Mississippi river collapsed Wednesday, plunging cars and trucks together with massive chunks of concrete into the rushing waters, officials said.
Several cars were flung into the river and others crushed as parts of the bridge were sheared off.

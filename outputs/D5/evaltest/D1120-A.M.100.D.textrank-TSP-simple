The study, prepared by a National Research Council committee, paints a sobering picture as the water needs of a rapidly expanding population test the limits of a river system strained by the effects of climate change.
The report acknowledges some uncertainty over whether climate change would alter the amount of precipitation in the basin.
Such measures as conservation, desalination and water recycling would be helpful, the authors said, but would "n't" offer a panacea.
But that supply is also finite, the authors emphasized, and shifting water from farm to city could have negative impacts.

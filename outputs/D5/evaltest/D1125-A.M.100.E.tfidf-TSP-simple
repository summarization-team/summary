Warmer temperatures have caused the Arctic ice cap to melt, shrinking the bears "'" hunting grounds and making it increasingly difficult for them to find food.
We have decided on this reduction in the 2007 quota to be more in line with a level suggested by biologists, who wanted an even lower number," a ministry of fisheries and hunting official, Ole Heinrich, told AFP.
The decision was taken after consultation with local authorities and the Greenland Hunters and Fishers Association (KNAPK), said Heinrich, who spoke to AFP by telephone from Greenland's capital Nuuk.

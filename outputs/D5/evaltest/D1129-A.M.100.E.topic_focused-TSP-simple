Raising vitamin D levels by taking supplements and absorbing a little bit of sunshine each day may help prevent colorectal and breast cancers, said two studies published Tuesday.
A high blood level of vitamin D could help reduce the risk of breast cancer by half and of colorectal cancer by two-thirds, the studies found.
The colorectal cancer research, published online in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, analyzed five studies on 1,448 individuals that explored the association of blood levels of vitamin D with colon cancer risk.

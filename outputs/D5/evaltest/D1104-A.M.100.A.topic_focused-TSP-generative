Menu Foods, a major pet food manufacturer, recalled over 60 million containers of wet pet food sold under various brands due to reports of kidney failure and deaths in cats and dogs.
The company, based in Ontario, Canada, produces over 1 billion containers of pet food annually.
Concerned pet owners across North America are urged to check their cupboards for the affected products.
The recall includes gravy-style pet food made between December 3 and March 6.
Menu Foods is working with authorities to investigate the issue, which may be linked to a new wheat gluten supplier.

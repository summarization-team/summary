A major pet food manufacturer, Menu Foods, recalled millions of containers of wet dog and cat food sold under various brands due to reports of kidney failure and deaths in pets.
The company, based in Ontario, Canada, produces over 1 billion containers annually.
Concerned pet owners across North America are urged to check their cupboards for the affected products.
The recall includes gravy-style pet food made between December 3 and March 6.
The company is investigating the link between the illnesses and a new wheat gluten supplier.
The FDA is conducting a full investigation into the matter.

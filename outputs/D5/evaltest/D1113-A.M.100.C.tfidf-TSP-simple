A team of US scientists has used DNA testing to identify the geographic origin of poached elephant tusks--research they hope may help curb the illegal ivory trade.
The seizure of the shipment from Malawi bound for the Far East was the largest since a 1989 international convention banning the ivory trade took effect and represented ivory from 3,000 to 6,500 elephants.
Assuming only about 10 percent of contraband is detected, the actual amount of poached ivory was closer to 234,000 kilograms (514,800 pounds), or 23,000 elephants, about five percent of Africa's total population.

Vick, 27, Purnell Peace, 35, and Quanis Phillips, 28 pleaded innocent last week.
All three, as well as Taylor, face a maximum five-year prison sentence if convicted on a felony conspiracy charge.
Taylor, 34, is scheduled to be sentenced on December 14.
Tony Taylor, among four men charged with organizing and staging dogfights across US state border lines, has changed his plea to guilty, ESPN and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
Taylor said he would not receive any specific sentencing break based upon his deal to testify to authorities regarding people's roles in the conspiracy.

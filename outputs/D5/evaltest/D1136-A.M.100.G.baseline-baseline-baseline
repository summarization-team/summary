China plans to cut its average water consumption by 20 percent by the end of 2010 in an effort to avert a looming shortage crisis, state media reported Thursday.
The government will set up consumption quotas and make local officials responsible for managing the use of water, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing the ministry of water resources.
The government also aims to establish 100 pilot water-saving schemes in the run- up to 2010, and to roll out successful projects across the nation, according to the agency.

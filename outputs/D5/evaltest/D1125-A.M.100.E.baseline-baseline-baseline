Greenland on Thursday said it would cut its annual quota for its polar bear hunt as the animal was threatened by climate change.
Warmer temperatures have caused the Arctic ice cap to melt, shrinking the bears "'" hunting grounds and making it increasingly difficult for them to find food.
Hunters, who can get up to 2,685 euros (3,500 dollars) for a bear pelt, had been killing around 250 bears a year before the first quota of 150 kills was introduced for 2006.
The quota for 2007 has now been reduced to 139 in the semi- autonomous Danish territory.

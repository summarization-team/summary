The trial of ex-warlord Charles Taylor, facing war crimes charges, has been moved to The Hague due to security concerns.
His lawyers have threatened to withdraw, citing inadequate time and resources.
Taylor, accused of aiding rebel groups in civil wars that killed 400,000, demands more time to prepare his defense.
The prosecution, with more resources, must prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
Witnesses are hesitant to testify due to UN travel bans.
Taylor's trial, delayed once, is set to begin in June, with concerns over fairness and adequate defense resources.

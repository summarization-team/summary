The trial of ex-warlord Charles Taylor, facing war crimes charges, has been moved to The Hague to ensure security and avoid unrest in West Africa.
Taylor's lawyers have threatened to withdraw due to inadequate time and resources, hindering his defense preparation.
The prosecution, led by prosecutor Stephen Rapp, insists on a fair trial and sufficient resources for the defense.
Witnesses are hesitant to testify due to UN travel bans, impacting the trial's progress.
Taylor maintains his innocence to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, with the trial set to begin in June.

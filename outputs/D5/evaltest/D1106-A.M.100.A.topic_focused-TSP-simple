International tuna bodies demand catch limits
Two international fishing industry groups called for limits to tuna catches Wednesday to stop the population of the fish from deteriorating due to overfishing.
Japan eats a quarter of the world "'s" tuna, more than any other country, but faces pressure from environmentalists, who have blamed the global fad for Japanese food for bringing tuna numbers to the brink of extinction.
Japan has also accepted a major cut in its quota for southern bluefin tuna in the Pacific Ocean as punishment for overfishing.

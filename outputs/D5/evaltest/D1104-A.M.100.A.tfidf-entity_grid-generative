A major pet food manufacturer, Menu Foods, issued a recall of 60 million containers of wet dog and cat food sold under various brands like Wal-Mart and Safeway due to reports of kidney failure and pet deaths.
The recall covers products sold between Dec. 3 and March 6 in North America.
Concerned pet owners were urged to check the company's website for a list of affected products.
Other companies like Nestle Purina and Hills Pet Nutrition also recalled some products made by Menu Foods.
The FDA confirmed deaths of pets linked to the contaminated food, prompting widespread worry and scrutiny.

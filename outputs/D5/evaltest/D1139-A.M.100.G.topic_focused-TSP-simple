Last week, the European Union started a security operation off the coast of Somalia, north of Kenya, to combat growing acts of piracy and protect ships carrying aid agency deliveries.
Pirates have seized control of the Saudi-owned super tanker Sirius Star off the east coast of Africa and are taking it towards a Somali port, the US Navy said on Monday.
Vela said the fully-laden tanker was seized by a group of armed men about 420 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia on Sunday.

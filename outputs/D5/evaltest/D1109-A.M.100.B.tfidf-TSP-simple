Israeli authorities have voiced concern that militants could have entered the country through its porous 250-kilometre (150-mile) border with the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.
One Israeli woman was killed and at least 11 people wounded in the bombing, which triggered scenes of panic in the desert town of Dimona.
The blast, at a shopping mall near Israel's top-secret nuclear reactor, was the first suicide bombing on Israeli soil since the relaunch of peace talks at a US conference in November and the first since January last year.

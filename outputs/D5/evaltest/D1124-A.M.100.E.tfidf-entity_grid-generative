An Indonesian minister, Aburizal Bakrie, denied responsibility for the "mud volcano" disaster on Java, caused by Lapindo Brantas Inc., a company linked to his family.
Despite experts blaming drilling errors, Bakrie insisted it was a natural disaster.
The mud flow, affecting 13,000 people, led to the suspension of flights and relocation of a railway line.
Efforts to stop the disaster included dropping concrete balls into the mud, but challenges persisted.
Environmental groups filed lawsuits against the government and energy firms, seeking accountability for the environmental damage and displacement of thousands.
President Susilo pledged compensation and mitigation measures.

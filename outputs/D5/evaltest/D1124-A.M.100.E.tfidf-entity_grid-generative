An Indonesian minister, Aburizal Bakrie, claimed the mud volcano in Java was a natural disaster unrelated to his family's company's drilling activities.
Lapindo Brantas Inc., owned by Bakrie's family, made a technical error in drilling, causing the disaster.
Bakrie's explanation was questioned by journalists and diplomats.
The mud flow, forcing 13,000 to flee, was blamed on an earthquake, not toxic, and could be dumped in the sea.
Pertamina halted a gas pipeline construction due to compensation issues.
Mount Semeru spewed ash, but officials assured no danger.
The railway near the mud volcano will be relocated

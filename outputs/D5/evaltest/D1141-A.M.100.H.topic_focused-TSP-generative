In Sichuan's Golok region, extreme measures were taken to ban grazing, forcing Tibetan herders to sell their herds and move into townships.
Many were required to slaughter livestock and abandon their traditional way of life.
Chinese officials cited overgrazing as the reason for the changes, leading to erosion and soil loss.
The relocation program aims to clear land for development, impacting nomadic Tibetan herders' livelihoods.
In other regions like Guizhou, stone desertification threatens farmers, prompting the government to implement soil conservation efforts.
Despite challenges, China is working to reverse soil erosion and improve sustainable agriculture practices.

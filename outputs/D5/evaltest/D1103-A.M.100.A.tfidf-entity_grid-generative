Two ETA members, Irkus Badillo and Gorka Vidal, were sentenced to 22 years each for transporting explosives to Madrid before the 2004 bombings.
They aimed to "sow panic" in Madrid with 500 kilograms of explosives.
Badillo and Vidal will also appear in the trial of the Madrid train bombers.
The bombings killed 191 people and injured 1,824, with suspects facing up to 40,000 years in jail.
The trial, expected to last five months, opened amid tight security in Madrid.
The attacks were inspired by Al-Qaeda and linked to Spain's involvement in Iraq.

The incident revived fears of extremist violence, despite the dismantling of previous radical groups like November 17 and ELA.
Italian Foreign Minister condemned the attack, expressing solidarity with the US.
US officials praised Greek authorities' response and are cooperating in the investigation.
No casualties were reported, and the embassy was occupied at the time.
The attack, reminiscent of past strikes, underscores ongoing security challenges in Greece.

Italian Foreign Minister condemned the attack, expressing solidarity with the US.
US officials praised Greek authorities' response and cooperation in the investigation.
No casualties were reported, but the embassy sustained damage.
The attack, reminiscent of past strikes, highlighted the ongoing threat of domestic militant groups in Greece.

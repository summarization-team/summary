Telomeres--nubby strips of DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes--predict a man's risk of developing heart disease, according to study published in Saturday's issue of The Lancet.
Telomeres get shorter each time a cell divides.
Shorter telomeres indicate older cells and are thus a marker of biological ageing, which varies according to the individual.
British doctors measured the length of telomeres in the chromosomes of white blood cells among men aged 45-64 who had enrolled in a big study on coronary prevention in western Scotland.

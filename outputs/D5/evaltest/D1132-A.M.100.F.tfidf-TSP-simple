The arrests follow a similar incident Monday off Sabah's waters, where marine police detained 19 Chinese nationals from Hainan with 78 turtles, most of them dead as well.
Seventeen Chinese nationals in a wildlife poaching outfit have been caught with 240 protected turtles, most of them dead, in the second such seizure this week, police said Thursday.
Only 20 of the 240 Hawksbill and Green turtles were found alive after marine police arrested the poachers, from southern Hainan province, off the coast of eastern Sabah state.

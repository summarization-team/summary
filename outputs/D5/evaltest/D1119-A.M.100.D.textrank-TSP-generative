A group of pediatricians and public health officials petitioned the FDA to restrict marketing of cold medicines like Toddler's Dimetapp and Infant Triaminic to children under 6.
Concerns arose due to insufficient testing in children, leading to overdoses and rare medical problems.
Johnson & Johnson voluntarily recalled certain infant cough and cold products to prevent misuse and overdoses.
The FDA advised against giving cough and cold medications to children under 2 without a doctor's approval.
Industry leaders withdrew infant cough and cold medicines from the market to address safety concerns, prompting calls for a ban on such products.

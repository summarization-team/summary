A group of pediatricians and public health officials petitioned the FDA to restrict marketing of cold medicines like Dimetapp and Triaminic to kids under 6.
Concerns arose due to insufficient testing in children, leading to overdoses and rare medical problems.
Johnson & Johnson voluntarily recalled infant cough and cold products to prevent misuse and overdoses.
The FDA advised against giving these medicines to children under 2 without a doctor's approval.
Industry leaders withdrew infant cough and cold medicines from the market, acknowledging the risk of misuse and overdose, prompting calls for a ban on such products.

Roberts killed himself in the one-room remote Amish schoolhouse before police could get to him, State Police Commissioner Jeffrey Miller told a press conference.
Roberts, a 32-year-old truck driver, married with children, entered the Georgetown Amish School and took about 30 children, as well as teachers and assistants, hostage, Miller said.
A number of the victims, that we removed out of here that did not expire on the site, were shot in the head, some were shot in the arms," Miller said.

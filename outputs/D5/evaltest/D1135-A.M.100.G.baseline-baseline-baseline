New York broker Bernard Madoff's alleged giant pyramid scheme duped some of the world's smartest investors, reports suggested Saturday, adding to questions about why the scam was "n't" uncovered earlier.
Evidence emerged that Madoff's alleged multi-billion-dollar fraud stretched from Tokyo to Europe to top US investors, all of them apparently unaware until the broker's arrest Thursday that they were being conned.
Prosecutors allege that Madoff, a decades-long veteran of Wall Street and pillar of the US financial community, confessed to losing at least 50 billion dollars in the so-called Ponzi scheme, or pyramid fraud.

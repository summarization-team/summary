Japan has also accepted a major cut in its quota for southern bluefin tuna in the Pacific Ocean as punishment for overfishing.
An international commission in November reduced the world's gross catch of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean from 32,000 tons this year to 29,500 tons for 2007, a move likely to lead to an import crunch in Japan.
Two international fishing industry groups called for limits to tuna catches Wednesday to stop the population of the fish from deteriorating due to overfishing.

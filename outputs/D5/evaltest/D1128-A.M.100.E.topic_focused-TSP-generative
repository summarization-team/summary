Former Liberian president Charles Taylor's lawyers are threatening to withdraw from his war crimes case, citing a lack of time and resources.
Taylor, accused of aiding rebel groups in civil wars that left 400,000 dead, faces 11 charges of crimes against humanity.
His defense team pleads for more time to prepare, as witnesses fear travel bans for testifying.
Despite complaints about insufficient resources, prosecutors believe Taylor's defense is adequately funded.
The trial, moved to The Hague to avoid unrest, is set to begin on June 4.
Potential defense witnesses are hesitant to testify due to fears of U.N. sanctions.

Former Liberian president Charles Taylor's lawyers are considering withdrawing from his war crimes case due to lack of time and resources.
Taylor, accused of aiding rebel groups in civil wars that killed 400,000 people, faces 11 charges of crimes against humanity.
His defense team requested more time to prepare, citing difficulties in securing witnesses who fear UN travel bans.
Despite facing allegations of orchestrating war crimes in Sierra Leone, Taylor maintains his innocence.
The trial, moved to The Hague to prevent unrest, is set to begin on June 4.
Witnesses are hesitant to testify, fearing repercussions from the Security Council.

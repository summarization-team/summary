Former American football star OJ Simpson was questioned by police in Las Vegas over an alleged armed robbery at a casino hotel room.
Simpson, released without charge, was assisting the investigation into the incident involving "sports-related products."
He was found liable in a 1997 civil suit for the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, ordered to pay $33.5 million.
Simpson, currently behind bars, faces charges including kidnapping and armed robbery.
Witnesses stated Simpson did not possess a gun during the alleged robbery, with another man arrested in connection.
Simpson maintains he was recovering stolen items, denying involvement of firearms.

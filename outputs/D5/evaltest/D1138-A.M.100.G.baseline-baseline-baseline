Russian lawmakers on Wednesday adopted on first reading a law which will allow local hospitals to remove and transplant organs, something only the big hospitals have been allowed to do.
The 421 lawmakers of the Duma lower house of parliament voted unanimously in favour of the text, pointing to a lack of available organs as things stand.
Local hospitals, which take in the majority of ill people, who need urgent treatment, cannot remove organs," the law said.

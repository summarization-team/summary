A suicide bombing at a shopping mall near Israel's nuclear reactor marked the first attack on Israeli soil since peace talks resumed.
The breach between Egypt and Gaza allowed militants to potentially enter Israel, leading to a bombing in Dimona that killed one and injured 11.
Confusion arose over the attackers' origins, with Hamas denying involvement.
Fatah's Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility, along with other groups.
The incident prompted heightened security measures and condemnation from France.
Despite the violence, efforts to revive peace talks continue amidst ongoing tensions in the region.

A tragic incident unfolded at an Amish school in Pennsylvania, where a gunman, identified as Charles Carl Roberts IV, shot several girls, killing five, before taking his own life.
The community was left in shock as Roberts, described as an ordinary man and devoted father, carried out the horrific act.
Motivated by a childhood grudge, Roberts tied up and shot the girls, claiming to seek revenge for a past event.
The Amish community, known for their faith and resilience, mourned the loss of the young victims in a private gathering, reminiscent of their response to past tragedies.

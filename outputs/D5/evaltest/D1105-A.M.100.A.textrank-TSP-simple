There are three foreign citizens, all American from one family," Adam Air spokesman Ali told AFP.
The Adam Air Boeing 737-400 crashed Monday after vanishing off air traffic control radar screens between the Indonesian islands of Java and Sulawesi.
Three Americans were among the 102 passengers and crew on board an Adam Air plane which crashed into a remote mountainous region of Indonesia, an airline official said Tuesday.
It was not immediately known whether the Americans were among the survivors.

Michael Vick and three co-defendants are facing charges related to a dogfighting conspiracy.
Tony Taylor, one of the defendants, has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
The indictment alleges that Vick financed the illegal operation, which involved organizing fights and betting on dogs.
Animal rights groups have protested the gruesome allegations, leading to Vick's suspension from the NFL.
Despite the legal battle ahead, Vick's sponsors have already cut ties with him.
This case highlights the dark world of dogfighting and the consequences for those involved, including Vick's uncertain future in football.

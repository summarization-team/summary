Formally known as the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Virginia Tech was founded in 1872 as a land-grant school--a college or university designated at its founding by state or federal lawmakers to teach agriculture, military tactics, or the mechanical arts so that members of the working class could obtain a liberal, practical education.
The university dominates the life in the southwestern Virginia town of Blacksburg with its population of just 40,000, and the school's 900-million dollar budget drives the local economy.

Pirates have seized the Saudi-owned super tanker Sirius Star off the east coast of Africa and are heading towards a Somali port, marking the largest ship ever taken by Somali pirates.
The European Union initiated a security operation to combat piracy in the region.
The US Navy expressed concern over the pirates' evolving tactics.
The vessel was fully loaded with crude oil and its crew of 25 members are safe.
The incident highlights the challenges of patrolling the vast Indian Ocean.
The owner, Vela International, is working to secure the release of the crew and the ship.

Former American football star OJ Simpson was questioned by Las Vegas police over an alleged armed robbery at a casino hotel room.
He was found liable in a 1997 civil suit and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
Simpson, along with a group of men, entered a room pretending to be customers.
Despite being released without charge initially, he was later taken into custody again.
Simpson faces charges including kidnapping and armed robbery.
Witnesses reported that Simpson did not possess a gun during the incident.
He denied involvement in the robbery, claiming he was only recovering stolen items.

Former American football star OJ Simpson was questioned by Las Vegas police over an alleged armed robbery at a casino hotel room.
He was found liable in a 1997 civil suit and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
Simpson, along with a group of men, entered a room pretending to be customers, leading to his arrest.
Despite denying robbery allegations, he faces charges including kidnapping and armed robbery.
Simpson's co-defendants are set to plead guilty and testify against him.
The incident involved holding memorabilia dealers at gunpoint, with conflicting reports on the presence of guns.
Simpson continues to maintain his innocence.

Despite red flags, hedge fund companies continued promoting Mr. Madoff's funds, leading to a massive pyramid scheme that duped smart investors worldwide.
The alleged fraud spanned from Tokyo to Europe to top US investors, all unaware until Madoff's arrest.
With losses exceeding $50 billion, the scandal impacted major European banks and even Spain's largest bank, Santander.
Regulators across Europe are scrambling to assess the damage, with some British pension funds and insurance companies also affected.
Madoff's arrest shed light on systemic failures in oversight, leaving investors angry and questioning the lack of accountability in the financial industry.

The family of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, facing charges of war crimes, said Friday that his lawyers have threatened to withdraw from the case, claiming a lack of time and resources.
The lawyers argued that the time and resources available to them were so inadequate that it places them in a position of conflict with their professional obligation and renders the possibility of fair trial impossible", the family said in a statement sent to AFP.
The lawyers threaten to withdraw their services if the situation does not change", the statement said.

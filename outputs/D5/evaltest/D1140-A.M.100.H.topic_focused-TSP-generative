Monsoon rains and snowmelt have left 200,000 people stranded in northern Bangladesh, where annual floods are common due to the country's network of rivers.
The situation has worsened, with over 100 deaths reported in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.
Millions have been displaced, prompting a massive relief effort.
The government is mobilizing resources to assist those affected, with the UK providing financial aid for relief efforts.
As the floodwaters continue to rise, the situation remains critical, with more areas at risk of inundation in the coming days.

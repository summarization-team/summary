The report said at least 300 million people in China were affected by diseases stemming from tainted food sources every year, but did not elaborate.
Tainted food impacts at least 300 million Chinese people a year and could lead to a disease outbreak that exacts a huge social and economic toll, the Asian Development Bank warned Monday.
Food-related diseases pose a constant threat to consumers and if not addressed could lead to an outbreak with a bigger impact than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic that struck China in 2002-2003, it said.

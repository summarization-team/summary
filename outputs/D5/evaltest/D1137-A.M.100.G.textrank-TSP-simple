A giant crane separated from the side of a skyscraper under construction and smashed into a block of residential buildings Saturday, killing at least two people on Manhattan's East Side.
Maureen Shey, who lives diagonal from the building where the crane collapsed, said she was on the phone laying on her bed when she saw the giant white crane heading straight for her windows.
An intensive, but delicate rescue operation was under way to free anyone still trapped in the rubble.
Part of it came to rest against an apartment tower, buckling its facade and smashing it upper floors.

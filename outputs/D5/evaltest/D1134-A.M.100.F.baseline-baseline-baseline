Twenty-two women who took part in recent trials for a gel designed to prevent HIV infection during intercourse have contracted the virus, South Africa's health ministry said on Wednesday.
The announcement of the number infections comes a day after Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang ordered an investigation into the microbicide clinical trials in the eastern KwaZulu Natal province.
We have found that about 22 women from the 604 participants at the trial site in KwaZulu-Natal were infected by the AIDS virus," health spokesman, Sibani Mngadi told AFP.

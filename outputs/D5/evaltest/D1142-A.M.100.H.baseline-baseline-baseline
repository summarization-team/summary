Seven near-simultaneous bomb blasts tore through crowded markets in the Indian tourist city of Jaipur Tuesday, killing at least 80 people and wounding 200 in what police said was a terror attack.
We have information that 80 people have died," Rajasthan state home minister Gulab Chand Kataria told reporters.
One suspect was detained and is being investigated," he added in Jaipur, the state capital.
One of the explosions went off near a packed Hindu temple, leaving pools of blood outside in the street and cycles and rickshaws in a mangled heap, television pictures showed.

At least six people were killed after a bridge over the Mississippi river collapsed Wednesday, plunging cars and trucks together with massive chunks of concrete into the rushing waters, officials said.
Images shot by local television showed a disastrous scene of people crouching on bent and crumpled concrete with parts of the bridge submerged in the brown river as smoke and flames drifted from the wreckage.

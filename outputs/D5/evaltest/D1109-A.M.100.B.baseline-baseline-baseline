Canada vehemently condemned Monday's suicide attack in Israel and said it should not be allowed to derail the Middle East peace process.
The blast, at a shopping mall near Israel's top-secret nuclear reactor, was the first suicide bombing on Israeli soil since the relaunch of peace talks at a US conference in November and the first since January last year.
This cowardly incident is another reminder that terrorism cannot be allowed to succeed.
Those who choose to use terrorist violence only damage the cause they claim to represent," Canadian Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier said.

The Hong Kong-registered tanker Hebei Spirit, carrying 15,000 tons of oil, was pierced in three places off Mallipo, southwest of Seoul.
Efforts to contain the spill involved a fleet of ships dispersing chemicals and pumping up the oil.
This incident surpassed South Korea's previous worst oil spill in 1995.
Despite fears of an ecological disaster, the leak was eventually stopped.
The spill affected the coastline near Mallipo beach, a popular area known for its scenic beauty and wildlife habitats.
The cleanup operation involved multiple ships and helicopters, with environmental damage expected to be less severe due to cold winter temperatures.

The Hong Kong-registered tanker Hebei Spirit, carrying 15,000 tons of oil, was pierced in three places off Mallipo, southwest of Seoul.
Authorities scrambled to contain the spill with a five-mile boom and dispersant chemicals.
This incident surpassed South Korea's previous worst oil spill in 1995.
Despite leaking 10,500 tons, the tanker was no longer leaking.
Concerns of an ecological disaster loomed as cleanup crews worked tirelessly.
The spill prompted a massive emergency response involving 40 ships and four helicopters.
The region's scenic beaches and wildlife habitats were at risk as oil reached the western shore.

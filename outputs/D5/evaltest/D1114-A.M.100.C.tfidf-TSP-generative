A study published in The Lancet revealed that men with shorter telomeres are at a higher risk of heart disease.
Telomeres, DNA strips at chromosome ends, can predict heart disease risk.
Measuring telomere length in middle-aged men could identify those at risk and guide statin treatment.
A gene variant in women also predisposes them to heart disease.
Gum disease may increase pancreatic cancer risk, as shown in a study analyzing data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.
Additionally, air pollution poses a significant threat to postmenopausal women's cardiovascular health, emphasizing the importance of early risk identification and intervention.

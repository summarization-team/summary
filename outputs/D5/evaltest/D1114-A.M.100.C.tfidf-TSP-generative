A study published in The Lancet revealed that men with shorter telomeres are at a higher risk of heart disease.
Telomeres, DNA strips at chromosome ends, can predict heart disease risk.
Measuring telomere length in middle-aged men could help identify those at risk and guide them to statin treatment.
Another study found a gene variant in women that predisposes them to heart disease.
Gum disease was linked to a higher risk of pancreatic cancer in men.
Additionally, air pollution was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women.
These findings highlight the importance of early risk identification and lifestyle choices to reduce heart disease

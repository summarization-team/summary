Taylor is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between 1989 and 2003 which left some 400,000 people dead.
The family of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, facing charges of war crimes, said Friday that his lawyers have threatened to withdraw from the case, claiming a lack of time and resources.

Images shot by local television showed a disastrous scene of people crouching on bent and crumpled concrete with parts of the bridge submerged in the brown river as smoke and flames drifted from the wreckage.
The 40-year-old arch bridge which rises 64 feet (20 meters) over the river was undergoing repairs at the time of the accident, and there were reports that construction workers were using a jackhammer at the time of the collapse, AFP has learned.
Traffic was bumper-to-bumper at the time, and he estimated hundreds of people must have been involved.

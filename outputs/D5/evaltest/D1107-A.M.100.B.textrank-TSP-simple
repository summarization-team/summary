In recent years, China's actual food safety situation has not led one to be optimistic," the financial institute said in a report posted on its website.
If a large-scale epidemic linked to food explodes in China, the negative impact could be more serious, especially if one considers the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai World Expo and the Guangzhou Asian Games," the report said.
Tainted foodstuffs could also have a negative impact on China's food export industry, which earned 27.6 billion dollars in 2005, it added.

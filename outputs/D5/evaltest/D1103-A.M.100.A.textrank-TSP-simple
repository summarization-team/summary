Two members of Basque separatist group ETA arrested while transporting half a tonne of explosives to Madrid just prior to the March 2004 bombings Monday received jail sentences of 22 years each.
Judicial investigators, the police and a parliamentary investigation ruled out ETA involvement in the bombings.
A third ETA member, Benat Barrondo, was jailed for five years for collaborating with a terrorist group.
The two men were jailed for belonging to a terrorist group, conspiring to commit terrorist offences and illegally transporting explosives.

Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare Aburizal Bakrie has said little about the environmental disaster and his explanation at a Jakarta Foreign Correspondents "'" Club lunch was questioned by journalists and diplomats.
Bakrie also said the mud, which has forced 13,000 people to flee and continues to spread, was not toxic and could be dumped in the sea without concern.
But Bakrie claimed nothing could have prevented the disaster, quoting "international and national experts," and instead blamed it on an earthquake hundreds of kilometres from the site of the mud flow.

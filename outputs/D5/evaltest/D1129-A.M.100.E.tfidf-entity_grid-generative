Researchers found that maintaining a serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in cancer risk can be achieved by taking 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily and spending 10 to 15 minutes in the sun.
Light-skinned individuals may need less sun exposure than darker-skinned individuals to achieve the same benefit.
Studies showed that higher blood levels of vitamin D were associated with lower rates of breast and colorectal cancer.
Experts recommend considering vitamin D supplements, especially for those at higher risk of deficiency.
Increasing vitamin D intake could potentially prevent hundreds of thousands of cancer cases annually.

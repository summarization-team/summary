Seventeen Chinese nationals from Hainan were arrested for poaching 240 protected turtles in Sabah, Malaysia.
Most turtles were dead, highlighting the illegal trade driven by China's demand for turtles.
The poachers faced fines and jail time, with some opting for imprisonment over payment.
Despite the arrests, authorities expect more poaching due to the lucrative trade.
In another incident, 17 Chinese fishermen were jailed for poaching turtles in Malaysia.
The global issue of turtle poaching extends to Bangladesh, where endangered sea turtles are dying due to pollution and illegal fishing practices.
The conservation efforts include captive breeding programs to protect endangered turtle species.

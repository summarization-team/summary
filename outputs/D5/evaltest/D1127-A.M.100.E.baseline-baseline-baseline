Chronic sleep deprivation can do more than leave you short- tempered: it can also stress your heart and raise your risk of cardiovascular disease and death, according to a study released Wednesday.
The neurological and behavioural effects of long-term sleep loss have been well- documented, ranging from lowered concentration and hand-eye coordination to poor mood.
But the study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine adds to a growing body of evidence that there is also a physiological price to be paid for insufficient time under the sheets.

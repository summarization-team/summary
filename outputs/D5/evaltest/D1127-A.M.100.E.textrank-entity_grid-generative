Chronic sleep deprivation not only affects mood but also poses serious risks to heart health, as shown in recent studies.
Even just five nights of insufficient sleep can impair heart function and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and death.
Research from Japan and the US highlights the negative impact of sleep deficits on heart health, with early risers being at higher risk.
Additionally, sleep deprivation can lead to memory issues, weight gain, and even hypertension, particularly affecting women more than men.
Adequate sleep is crucial for overall physical and mental well-being, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing rest.

A crisis center official confirmed the tanker stopped leaking after spilling 10,500 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea, the worst oil spill in South Korea's history.
Clean-up efforts continued overnight to prevent further damage to marine farms.
The collision with a barge caused the tanker to leak, with authorities struggling to contain the spill using dispersants and booms.
Despite challenges like strong winds, efforts were made to prevent the oil from reaching the coastline.
The spill, estimated to be larger than 10,000 tons, posed a significant threat to the environment and local economy.

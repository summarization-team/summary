A crisis center official confirmed the tanker stopped leaking after spilling 10,500 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea, the worst oil spill in South Korea's history.
Clean-up crews worked overnight to contain the five-kilometer oil slick threatening marine farms.
The collision with a barge caused the tanker to leak 66,000 barrels of oil, with efforts to prevent shoreline damage ongoing.
Despite the spill being the largest in South Korea, officials believe environmental impact will be minimized due to cold temperatures freezing the oil.
The Coast Guard is actively working to clean up the spill and prevent further contamination.

Aburizal Bakrie, the Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare, faced scrutiny over his handling of the environmental disaster caused by a mud volcano in Indonesia.
He claimed the mud was not toxic and blamed the catastrophe on an earthquake, distancing it from his family's drilling company, Lapindo Brantas Inc.
The eruption, triggered by drilling activities, has submerged villages and forced thousands to flee.
Efforts to stop the mud flow include dropping concrete balls into the volcano, although experts doubt its effectiveness.
The government is also relocating infrastructure to mitigate the impact of the disaster.

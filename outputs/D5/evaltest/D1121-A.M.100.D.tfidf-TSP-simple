All three, as well as Taylor, face a maximum five-year prison sentence if convicted on a felony conspiracy charge.
A plea agreement revealed on Monday with one of Michael Vick's federal dogfighting conspiracy co-defendants could give the American football star another hurdle in his upcoming legal fight.
Taylor said he would not receive any specific sentencing break based upon his deal to testify to authorities regarding people's roles in the conspiracy.

Officials in both Bangladesh and across the border in India--which is also expecting highly destructive winds and torrential rains--have been racing to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from the coast over the past 48 hours.
An official at the ministry of disaster management and relief, however, said damage to property and infrastructure would be severe.
An official in Barisal, 120 kilometres south of Dhaka, spoke of severe destruction as the 500 kilometre-wide mass of cloud passed overhead.
The storm matched one in 1991 that sparked a tidal wave that killed an estimated 138,000 people, Karmakar told AFP.

An official in Barisal, 120 kilometres south of Dhaka, spoke of severe destruction as the 500 kilometre-wide mass of cloud passed overhead.
He said large-scale damage to power and communication lines was also expected.
(This) is a violent storm," said Samarendra Karmakar, the head of the Bangladeshi meteorological department.
The storm matched one in 1991 that sparked a tidal wave that killed an estimated 138,000 people, Karmakar told AFP.
So far only one death has been reported from cyclone Sidr--an elderly man who drowned when a boat crossing a river with 17 passengers capsized.

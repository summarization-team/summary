Juan Manuel Alvarez, convicted of causing a deadly Los Angeles train crash, faces life in prison without parole after a jury's recommendation.
Prosecutors argued Alvarez intentionally caused the Metrolink commuter line accident in 2005 for attention.
Alvarez parked his car on the tracks, leading to the collision that killed 11 people.
Despite claiming he intended to commit suicide, Alvarez was found guilty of murder.
His troubled past, including methamphetamine addiction and abusive upbringing, was highlighted in court.
Alvarez's family testified, painting a picture of a violent upbringing marked by abuse, incest, and substance abuse.

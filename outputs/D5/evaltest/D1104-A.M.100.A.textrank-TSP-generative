A major pet food manufacturer recalled 60 million containers of wet food sold under various brands due to reports of kidney failure and deaths in dogs and cats.
Complaints of vomiting and kidney failure prompted the recall, with affected products made using wheat gluten from a new supplier.
The recall covers numerous brands distributed across North America, sparking concerns among pet owners.
The FDA is investigating the issue, urging vigilance for symptoms of kidney failure in pets.
The company is working to identify the cause as affected animals showed signs of illness after consuming the food.

Our investigation so far shows that bad weather coupled with high and heavy waves had caused the ferry to sink," said Setio Rahardjo, head of the National Committee on Transportation Safety.
Fishermen and search and rescue teams have thus far found around 200 survivors following the sinking of the ferry off the coast of Java late Friday with some 600 on board, officials said.
Other rescue efforts were focusing on three liferafts with around 30 to 40 survivors which were found by helicopters on Sunday.

We did try to evacuate them by air, but the weather did not permit us to do so as the waves were up to four metres high and it was raining heavily," he told ElShinta, adding that food and drinks had been dropped to them.
Our investigation so far shows that bad weather coupled with high and heavy waves had caused the ferry to sink," said Setio Rahardjo, head of the National Committee on Transportation Safety.
Preliminary investigations showed bad weather was to blame for the accident, officials said as they continued to collect data.

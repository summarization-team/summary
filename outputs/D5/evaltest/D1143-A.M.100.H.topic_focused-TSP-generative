OJ Simpson, a renowned American football player from the 1970s, faced suspicion in the 1994 murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown-Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.
Following a reported robbery at a Las Vegas casino, Simpson was questioned by police and later arrested for an alleged armed robbery.
Despite being acquitted of the previous murders, Simpson now faces multiple felony charges, including kidnapping and armed robbery.
Co-defendants have agreed to testify against him, potentially leading to a trial.
Simpson, adamant about reclaiming his belongings, remains entangled in legal proceedings surrounding the incident.

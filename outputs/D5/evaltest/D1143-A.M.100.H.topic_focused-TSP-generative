Simpson, a prominent football player in the 1970s, faced suspicion in the 1994 murders of his ex-wife and her friend.
Following a reported robbery at a Las Vegas casino, Simpson was questioned and later arrested for armed robbery.
Despite denying the killings, Simpson was charged with multiple offenses, including kidnapping and armed robbery.
He claimed the items were his, leading to his arrest and subsequent plea agreement by a co-defendant to testify against him.
Simpson's involvement in the armed robbery case escalated, with the potential for a lengthy prison sentence if convicted.

OJ Simpson, a renowned American football player from the 1970s, was a suspect in the 1994 murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown-Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.
He was recently questioned by Las Vegas police regarding an alleged armed robbery at a casino hotel.
Simpson, who was acquitted of the murder charges in a highly publicized trial, now faces multiple felony charges related to the robbery.
Despite his denial of involvement with guns, Simpson remains in custody awaiting further legal proceedings.
The case involves several other individuals who are also facing charges and may testify against Simpson.

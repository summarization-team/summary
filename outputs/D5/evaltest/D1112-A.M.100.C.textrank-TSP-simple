Defense lawyers claimed however that Alvarez had parked his car on the tracks to commit suicide but was unable to remove it after he changed his mind at the last minute.
Prosecutors said Alvarez had deliberately caused the accident on the Metrolink commuter line on January 26, 2005 to get attention.
Jurors decided against recommending the death penalty for Alvarez.
A man found guilty of murder for causing a Los Angeles train crash that left 11 people dead should be jailed for life without parole, a jury recommended on Tuesday.

A major manufacturer of dog and cat food sold under Wal-Mart, Safeway, Kroger and other store brands recalled 60 million containers of wet pet food Friday after reports of kidney failure and deaths.
Henderson said the company received an undisclosed number of owner complaints of vomiting and kidney failure in dogs and cats after they had been fed its products.
Menu Foods said a full list of brand names and lot numbers covered by the recall would be posted on its Web site--http: //www.menufoods.com/recall--early Saturday.

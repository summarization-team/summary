Two recent studies suggest that raising vitamin D levels through supplements and sunlight exposure can significantly reduce the risk of breast and colorectal cancers.
The research, published in reputable journals, analyzed data from over 3,000 individuals and found a clear correlation between higher vitamin D levels and lower cancer rates.
Experts recommend daily vitamin D supplements, especially for those at higher risk of deficiency.
While sunlight is a natural source of vitamin D, dietary sources and supplements are also effective.
These findings highlight the potential of vitamin D in cancer prevention and overall health maintenance.

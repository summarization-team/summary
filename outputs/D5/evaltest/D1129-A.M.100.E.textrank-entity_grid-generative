A recent study suggests that raising vitamin D levels through supplements and sun exposure may reduce the risk of breast and colorectal cancers.
High blood levels of vitamin D were linked to a 50% lower risk of breast cancer and a 66% lower risk of colorectal cancer.
The study also found that individuals with the lowest blood levels had the highest rates of breast cancer.
Recommendations include taking 1,000 IU of vitamin D daily, especially for those at higher risk of deficiency.
Adequate vitamin D intake may help prevent cancer, with sunlight exposure being a key factor in reducing breast cancer risk.

Israeli authorities have voiced concern that militants could have entered the country through its porous 250-kilometre (150-mile) border with the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.
The attack came after a near two-week breach of the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip which saw hundreds of thousands of people pouring into Egypt from the impoverished Hamas-run territory in a bid to break a crippling Israeli siege.

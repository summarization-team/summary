At least six people were killed after a bridge over the Mississippi river collapsed Wednesday, plunging cars and trucks together with massive chunks of concrete into the rushing waters, officials said.
Several cars were flung into the river and others crushed as parts of the bridge were sheared off.
A semi-truck caught fire after it was sliced in half, while a busload of children was stranded on a collapsed section of the roadway.
Some estimates said dozens of vehicles fell into the river, but that could not be confirmed.

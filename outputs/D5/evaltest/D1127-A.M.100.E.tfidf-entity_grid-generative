A study on sleep deprivation and cardiovascular health revealed that insufficient sleep can stress the heart, increasing the risk of disease and death.
Research from the University of Pennsylvania and Kyoto University linked early wake-up times to heart conditions, contradicting the belief that early risers are healthier.
Athletes, like college basketball players, perform better with adequate sleep, while adolescents face increasing sleep issues.
Studies show that sleep deprivation affects memory, appetite, weight gain, and overall health.
Addressing sleep problems early, especially in adolescents, may prevent future health issues like substance use and hypertension.

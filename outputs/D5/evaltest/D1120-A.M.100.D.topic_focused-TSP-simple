Global warming will worsen drought and reduce flows on the Colorado River, a key water source for several western states, according to a report released Wednesday.
The river is a major source for Metropolitan, Southern California "'s" major urban water supplier.
Last year about 30 percent of the agency "'s" water deliveries came from the Colorado, which provides about 10 percent of California "'s" overall urban and agricultural supplies.

Photos published in news reports Thursday showed the dead turtles lined up in long stretches of five rows, as marine police made an inventory of the carcasses.
Only 20 of the 240 Hawksbill and Green turtles were found alive after marine police arrested the poachers, from southern Hainan province, off the coast of eastern Sabah state.
The arrests follow a similar incident Monday off Sabah's waters, where marine police detained 19 Chinese nationals from Hainan with 78 turtles, most of them dead as well.

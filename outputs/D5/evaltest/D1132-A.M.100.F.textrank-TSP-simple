Mohamad Sueb said police believed the men were all in the same group of poachers, citing similarities in the two boats and their equipment.
Mohamad Sueb said the fisheries department would be prosecuting the Chinese for encroaching in Malaysia's waters and poaching.
Seventeen Chinese nationals in a wildlife poaching outfit have been caught with 240 protected turtles, most of them dead, in the second such seizure this week, police said Thursday.

An Indonesian minister claimed Wednesday that a vast "mud volcano" which has inundated villages on the island of Java was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling activities of a company controlled by his family.
Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare Aburizal Bakrie has said little about the environmental disaster and his explanation at a Jakarta Foreign Correspondents "'" Club lunch was questioned by journalists and diplomats.
The mud is the sea mud," he said, adding it was laid down at a time in geological history when the area was covered by the sea.

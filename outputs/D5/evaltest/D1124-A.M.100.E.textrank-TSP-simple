Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar has said it could take years before the mud stops flowing.
Bakrie also said the mud, which has forced 13,000 people to flee and continues to spread, was not toxic and could be dumped in the sea without concern.
But Bakrie claimed nothing could have prevented the disaster, quoting "international and national experts," and instead blamed it on an earthquake hundreds of kilometres from the site of the mud flow.

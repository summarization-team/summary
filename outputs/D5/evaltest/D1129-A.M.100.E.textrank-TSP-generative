Taking vitamin D supplements and getting some sun exposure daily can lower the risk of colorectal and breast cancers.
Studies show that high vitamin D levels can reduce breast cancer risk by 50% and colorectal cancer risk by two-thirds.
Individuals with the lowest blood levels had the highest breast cancer rates, which decreased as vitamin D levels increased.
Recommendations include taking 1,000 IUs of vitamin D daily to reduce cancer risk.
Sunlight exposure helps the body produce vitamin D, which may lower the risk of breast cancer.
Ensuring adequate vitamin D intake through diet and supplements is crucial for cancer prevention.

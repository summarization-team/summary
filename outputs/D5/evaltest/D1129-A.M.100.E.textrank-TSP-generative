Taking vitamin D supplements and getting some sun daily can lower the risk of colorectal and breast cancers.
Studies show that high vitamin D levels can reduce breast cancer risk by 50% and colorectal cancer risk by two-thirds.
The research analyzed data from over 3,000 individuals and found a clear link between low vitamin D levels and higher cancer rates.
Experts recommend daily vitamin D intake of 1,000 IUs to reduce cancer risk.
Sun exposure helps the body produce vitamin D, but supplements and fortified foods are also good sources.
Increasing vitamin D levels may be a powerful cancer prevention strategy.

Two international fishing industry groups called for limits to tuna catches Wednesday to stop the population of the fish from deteriorating due to overfishing.
The Tokyo-based Organisation for the Promotion of Responsible Tuna Fisheries and the World Tuna Purse Seine Organisation, headquartered in Seoul, adopted a joint statement demanding a moratorium on the use of additional large tuna vessels, officials said.
The statement would be sent to five international tuna conservation bodies, which would hold their first joint meeting in Kobe, Japan, Monday through Friday next week, the officials said.

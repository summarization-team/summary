The Hong Kong-registered tanker Hebei Spirit, carrying 15,000 tons of oil, was pierced in three places off Mallipo, southwest of Seoul.
A spill of over 10,000 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea was South Korea's worst.
Cleanup efforts were swift, with 40 ships and helicopters involved.
The spill, though significant, was expected to have less environmental impact due to cold temperatures.
The oil slick affected about 4 miles of coastline near Mallipo beach.
The spill was contained after leaking 10.5 million liters of crude oil, making it South Korea's largest offshore spill.

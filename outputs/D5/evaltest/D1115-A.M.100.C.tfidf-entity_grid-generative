The Hong Kong-registered tanker Hebei Spirit, carrying 15,000 tons of oil, was pierced in three places off Mallipo, southwest of Seoul.
A spill of over 10,000 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea was South Korea's worst.
Cleanup efforts were underway to prevent ecological disaster.
The tanker, no longer leaking, spilled an estimated 10,500 tons.
The collision left three holes in the tanker, leading to the leak.
Efforts by coastguard ships and helicopters were focused on cleanup after the leak was contained.
The oil spill, though significant, was expected to cause less damage due to cold temperatures.

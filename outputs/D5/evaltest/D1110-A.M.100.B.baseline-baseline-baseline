China has allocated 200 million yuan (29 million dollars) for disaster relief work after an earthquake rocked the country's southwest killing more than 8,700 people, state press reported Tuesday.
The quake, with a magnitude of 7.8, struck close to densely populated areas in Sichuan province, including the capital Chengdu, shortly before 2:30 pm (0630 GMT) on Monday.
It is the worst to strike China since the Tangshan earthquake in 1976, which claimed 242,000 lives, Xinhua news agency said.
Xinhua said 8,533 people had died in Sichuan alone, citing the local government.

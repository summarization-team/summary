At least 200,000 people have been marooned in northern Bangladesh, as monsoon rains and snow melt from the Himalayas hit the flood-prone nation, state-run media said.
200,000 marooned in northern Bangladesh floods
Bangladesh is criss-crossed by a network of 230 rivers and suffers annual floods with at least a fifth of the country inundated each year.
The Brahmaputra, the source of two-thirds of river water in the country, was flowing at least 25 centimetres (one foot) above danger levels, the centre said.

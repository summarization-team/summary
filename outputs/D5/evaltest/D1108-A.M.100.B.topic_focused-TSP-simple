A fierce cyclone packing extreme winds and torrential rain smashed into Bangladesh "'s" southwestern coast Thursday, wiping out homes and trees in what officials described as the worst storm in years.
Karmakar said rivers in the Sunderbans area, a vast mangrove forest straddling the India-Bangladesh border and the natural habitat of endangered Royal Bengal tigers, were also swelling fast as the storm moved north in the direction of the capital Dhaka.
An official at the ministry of disaster management and relief, however, said damage to property and infrastructure would be severe.

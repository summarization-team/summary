Raising vitamin D levels by taking supplements and absorbing a little bit of sunshine each day may help prevent colorectal and breast cancers, said two studies published Tuesday.
A high blood level of vitamin D could help reduce the risk of breast cancer by half and of colorectal cancer by two-thirds, the studies found.
For the breast cancer study, published online in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, researchers analyzed data from two earlier studies on the response to vitamin D doses among 1,760 people.

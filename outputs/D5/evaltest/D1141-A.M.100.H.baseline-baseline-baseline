China is forcing nomadic Tibetan herders to settle in towns to clear land for development, leaving many unable to earn a living, a human rights group said in a report issued Sunday.
Herders have been forced to slaughter herds of yaks, sheep and goats and Communist officials have paid minimal compensation and failed to protect Tibetans "'" legal rights, Human Rights Watch said.
It said tens of thousands, and possibly hundreds of thousands, of people have been affected.

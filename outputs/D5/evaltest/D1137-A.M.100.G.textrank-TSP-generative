A giant crane broke free from a skyscraper, crashing into residential buildings on Manhattan's East Side, resulting in at least four deaths and numerous injuries.
Residents had previously raised concerns about the construction site's safety practices.
The crane's collapse during a procedure called "jumping" led to a devastating accident, prompting a delicate rescue operation.
Despite the tragedy, residents expressed gratitude that the incident occurred on a weekend with fewer people around.
The city's reliance on cranes was evident, with efforts underway to stabilize the situation and prevent further disasters.

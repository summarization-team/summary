Neighborhood residents said they had complained to the city several times about the construction at the site, saying crews worked illegal hours and the building was going up too fast.
About 19 of the 44 stories of the crane had been erected and it was to be extended Saturday, when a piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding it to the building, said Stephen Kaplan, an owner of Reliance Construction Group, which manages construction at the site.

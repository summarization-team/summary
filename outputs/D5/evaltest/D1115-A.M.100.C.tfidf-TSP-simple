The Hong Kong-registered tanker Hebei Spirit, carrying about 15,000 tons of oil, was berthed five miles off Mallipo, 90 kilometres (54 miles) southwest of Seoul, when it was pierced in three places.
Authorities battled to contain the oil inside a boom some eight kilometres (five miles) long to prevent it damaging the coastline, as a fleet of 28 ships scattered dispersant chemicals or tried to pump up the spillage.

Seventeen Chinese nationals in a wildlife poaching outfit have been caught with 240 protected turtles, most of them dead, in the second such seizure this week, police said Thursday.
Only 20 of the 240 Hawksbill and Green turtles were found alive after marine police arrested the poachers, from southern Hainan province, off the coast of eastern Sabah state.
Sabah marine police chief Mohamad Sueb Abdullah said marine police boarded the boat after sighting it in waters off the coast on Wednesday morning.

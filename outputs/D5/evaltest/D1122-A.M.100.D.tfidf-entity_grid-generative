A tragic incident occurred when a bridge over the Mississippi River collapsed during rush hour, killing at least six people.
The collapse was not linked to terrorism but rather to engineering issues.
Rescue efforts were hindered by the dangerous conditions, with cars and trucks submerged in the river.
The bridge was undergoing repairs at the time, and reports suggest construction work may have contributed to the collapse.
The community mourns the loss as investigations into the structural deficiencies of the bridge begin.
Recovery efforts continue as officials inspect similar bridges for safety concerns.

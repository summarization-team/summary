Chinese nationals have been arrested in Malaysia for turtle poaching, with two separate incidents this week.
The first group had 240 protected turtles, mostly dead, while the second group had 78 turtles, also mostly dead.
Only 20 turtles were found alive.
The poachers were from Hainan province and were sentenced to 18 months in jail.
China's demand for turtles for food and medicine has led to aggressive poaching in Southeast Asia, endangering sea turtle populations.
In a separate incident, a critically endangered river terrapin turtle was found in Thailand after being thought extinct for two decades.

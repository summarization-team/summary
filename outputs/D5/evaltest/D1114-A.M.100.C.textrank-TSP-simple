The same Scottish study also randomly assigned some volunteers to receive statins, a drug which breaks down artery-clogging cholesterol.
The researchers found that in the placebo group, the risk of heart disease was almost double among the men with short telomeres compared with counterparts with long telomeres.
But the good news was that in the statin group, those with short telomeres enjoyed a substantial cut in the risk of heart disease.
The study says that measuring the length of telomeres in middle- aged men could help pinpoint those most at risk of heart disease and direct them to statin treatment.

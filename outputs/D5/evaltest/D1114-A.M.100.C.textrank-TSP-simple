The same Scottish study also randomly assigned some volunteers to receive statins, a drug which breaks down artery-clogging cholesterol.
But the good news was that in the statin group, those with short telomeres enjoyed a substantial cut in the risk of heart disease.
The study says that measuring the length of telomeres in middle- aged men could help pinpoint those most at risk of heart disease and direct them to statin treatment.
The 484 men who went on to develop coronary heart disease had shorter telomeres than the 1,058 men who remained disease-free, the investigators discovered.

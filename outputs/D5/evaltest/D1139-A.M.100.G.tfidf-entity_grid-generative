The Saudi-owned super tanker Sirius Star has been seized by pirates off the Somali coast, highlighting their ability to adapt tactics.
The US Navy reports the largest ship ever seized, carrying crude oil worth $100 million.
The crew of 25 is safe, and efforts are underway for their release.
The pirates are taking the ship towards a Somali port, a hub of pirate activity.
This hijacking, far from the Gulf of Aden, shows the pirates' expanding reach and increasing capabilities, posing a significant challenge to maritime security in the region.

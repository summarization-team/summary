The Saudi-owned super tanker Sirius Star has been seized by pirates off the Somali coast, highlighting their ability to adapt tactics.
The pirates are taking the ship towards a Somali port, prompting Norwegian shipping company Odfjell to avoid the pirate-plagued Gulf of Aden.
NATO patrols the area, escorting humanitarian aid and protecting vital maritime routes.
The hijacking of the massive tanker, carrying crude oil, is the farthest out to sea Somali pirates have struck.
The situation underscores the challenges faced by international efforts to combat piracy in the region.

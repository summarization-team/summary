Six masked assailants abducted over 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, on Sipadan Island in Malaysia.
The dispute over the islands dates back to 1969 between Indonesia and Malaysia.
Two tourists managed to escape the gunmen.
The rebels responsible are demanding the release of militants jailed in the US.
The hostages include foreigners and local workers.
Malaysian and Philippine authorities are collaborating to track down the kidnappers.
The motive behind the abduction remains unclear, but efforts are underway to ensure the safety of the hostages.

Six masked assailants abducted over 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, on Sipadan Island in Malaysia.
The dispute over the islands dates back to 1969 between Indonesia and Malaysia.
The abductors surprised the group on the beach, with two tourists managing to escape.
The rebels responsible are demanding the release of militants jailed in the US.
Malaysian and Philippine authorities are collaborating to locate the hostages.
The hostages include foreign tourists and local workers, with efforts underway to secure their release.
The situation remains tense as rescue teams search for the assailants in Southeast Asian waters.

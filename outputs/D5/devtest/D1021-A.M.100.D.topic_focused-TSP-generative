Debra LaFave, a former schoolteacher, was accused of seducing a 14-year-old student in Florida.
She pleaded guilty to avoid prison time, citing her troubled marriage as a motive.
Despite being sentenced to house arrest and probation, her case attracted national attention due to her attractiveness.
Her lawyer argued against prison, emphasizing her beauty as a reason for leniency.
The victim's family pushed for harsher punishment, while media coverage intensified the scrutiny on Lafave.
Ultimately, she faced consequences such as registering as a sex offender and enduring ongoing mental health challenges.

The Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Affairs will survey assistance from a fund by 2000, following a study on Agent Orange victims.
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai assigned the Ministry to address the issue over a 10-year period.
Despite efforts, high toxicity levels persist in soil and individuals.
The exact number of affected individuals remains unknown.
Veterans from multiple countries exposed to Agent Orange continue to suffer, with no clear resolution in sight.
Ongoing research aims to provide answers, but the full extent of the damage caused by Agent Orange remains uncertain.

The Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs will survey assistance from the fund by 2000, following a study on Agent Orange victims.
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai assigned a 10-year plan to address the ongoing effects of the toxic chemical.
Despite efforts to strip away cover for North Vietnamese troops, high toxicity levels persist in the soil.
The true extent of those affected remains unknown, with birth defects and illnesses continuing to plague individuals.
Ongoing research aims to provide answers and support for those impacted by Agent Orange exposure, both in Vietnam and abroad.

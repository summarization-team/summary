Four police officers face trial for the shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant, Amadou Diallo.
The officers believed Diallo had a gun, leading to the fatal incident.
Amid public outcry, the officers chose not to testify before the grand jury.
The defense argues the shooting was a tragedy, not a crime, as they thought Diallo was reaching for a gun.
Forensic evidence will play a crucial role in the trial, challenging the officers' credibility.
The trial is set for January, with the defense preparing to review evidence and make motions.
The case highlights the ongoing pursuit of justice amidst controversy and legal proceedings.

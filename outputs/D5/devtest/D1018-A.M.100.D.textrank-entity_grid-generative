Two Surinamese brothers, Satish and Deepak Kaploe, claimed Natalee fell outside a hotel after drinking.
A black security guard approached her, but she refused help.
The brothers, along with Dutch citizen Joran Van Der Sloot, were arrested in connection with Natalee's disappearance.
Witnesses saw the group near a lighthouse before Natalee vanished.
The investigation led to the questioning of several individuals, including security guards and acquaintances of the suspects.
Despite ongoing searches and interrogations, Natalee's whereabouts remain unknown, leaving her mother hopeful yet frustrated with the lack of progress.

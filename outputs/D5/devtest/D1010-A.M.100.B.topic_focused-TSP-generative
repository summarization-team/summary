Japan, the largest export market for US beef, halted imports due to mad cow disease in 2003.
Talks have begun to resume shipments, with Japan initially demanding testing for all US beef.

Since 1996, concerns about variant CJD from infected meat have arisen.
In Europe, embargoes on British beef may be lifted due to a decline in mad cow cases.
Bulgaria faces issues with uncertified beef, while Canada has exceeded its mad cow testing goals.
The global impact of mad cow disease remains a significant concern.

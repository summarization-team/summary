Japan, the largest market for US beef, halted imports due to mad cow disease in 2003.
Talks have begun to resume shipments, with Japan initially demanding testing for all US beef.
However, the difficulty in detecting the disease in younger cows led to a compromise.
Since 1996, concerns about vCJD transmission have arisen.
In Europe, embargoes on British beef may be lifted due to a decline in mad cow cases.
Meanwhile, Bulgaria faces issues with uncertified beef, and Ireland reports its first suspected case of the human form of mad cow disease.

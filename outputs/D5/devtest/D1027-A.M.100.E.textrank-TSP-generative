The trial for Russell Henderson and Aaron James McKinney, both 21, charged with murder in the beating death of Matthew Shepard, has been postponed.
Henderson's trial was rescheduled to April 6 due to a scheduling conflict, while McKinney's trial is set for Aug. 9.
With jury selection starting on March 24, the case has drawn attention from gay rights activists.
Henderson's attorney claims he was only a witness to the brutal attack.
Despite graphic evidence, the trial aims to ensure justice for Shepard and address hate crimes that target individuals based on their identity.

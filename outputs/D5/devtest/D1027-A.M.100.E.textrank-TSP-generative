The trial for Russell Henderson and Aaron James McKinney, both 21, charged with murder in the beating death of Matthew Shepard, has been postponed.
Henderson's trial was rescheduled to April 6 due to a scheduling conflict, while McKinney's trial is set for Aug. 9.
With jury selection starting on March 24, the case has drawn attention from gay rights activists.
Henderson's attorney claims he was only a witness, not a participant in the brutal attack.
Despite the gruesome nature of the crime, only a few spectators were present in the courtroom.
The trial continues with intense scrutiny and emotional impact.

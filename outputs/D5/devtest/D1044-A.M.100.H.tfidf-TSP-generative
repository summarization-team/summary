The illegal dye Sudan 1 was found in chilli powder used by British company Premium Foods, leading to a recall of over 400 products in Britain and across the EU.
The Food Standards Agency is working to remove affected items from shelves and advises the public to return them for a refund.
The dye, linked to cancer risk, was used in various products including ready-made meals and sauces.
Investigations are ongoing to determine how the dye entered the food chain, with authorities urging caution and vigilance in consuming contaminated products.

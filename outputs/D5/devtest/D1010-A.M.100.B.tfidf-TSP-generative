Japanese and US officials are in talks to resume US beef shipments to Japan, the largest export market for US beef.
Japan had insisted on testing all US beef imports for mad cow disease, but the difficulty in detecting the disease in younger cows led Japan to reconsider.
Meanwhile, in Europe, embargoes on British beef may be lifted due to a significant decrease in mad cow disease cases.
Additionally, cases of the human form of mad cow disease have been reported in various countries, prompting increased testing and surveillance measures to prevent further spread.

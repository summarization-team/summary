All hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong have been ordered to test patients for the flu.
A number of the patients "'" relatives were also found developing flu-like symptoms and were undergoing tests.
At least seven staff who had contact with the victims were experiencing flu-like symptoms, but it was not clear if they had also contracted the H5N1 strain, local health officials said today.
A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the "bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.

Britain's food safety watchdog ordered the recall of over 350 products due to a cancer-causing dye found in a batch of chilli powder.
The dye, Sudan I, was used in Worcester sauce, contaminating a wide range of products.
The EU is on alert for the spread of this health scare.
Investigations are ongoing into how the dye entered the food chain.
China has also banned imports of any foods containing Sudan I.
It is illegal to use this dye in food in the UK and the EU.
The situation has sparked international concern and precautionary measures.

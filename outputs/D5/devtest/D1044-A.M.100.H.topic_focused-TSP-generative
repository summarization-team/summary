Britain's food safety watchdog, the Food Standards Agency (FSA), ordered the recall of over 350 food products due to the discovery of a potentially cancer-causing dye, Sudan I.
The dye was found in a batch of chilli powder used by a British company, leading to a widespread contamination of various food items.
The FSA extended the list of affected products and advised the public not to consume them.
Investigations are ongoing to determine how the illegal dye entered the food chain.
The European Union is also monitoring the situation to prevent the spread of the health scare to other countries.

Britain is facing a major food recall due to the discovery of a potentially cancer-causing dye, Sudan I, in over 350 food products.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is working to remove these products from shelves and advises the public to return them.
The dye, found in chilli powder used to make Worcester sauce, has led to the contamination of various food items.
The FSA is investigating three companies involved in the supply chain.
The EU is also monitoring the situation, as the dye originated from India and has spread to other countries.
Sudan I is banned in the EU, and efforts are underway to ensure food safety.

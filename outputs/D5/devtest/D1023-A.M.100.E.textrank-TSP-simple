WASHINGTON (AP)--Raising the minimum wage could deny some teen-agers their chance at entry-level jobs, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today.
Delivering the Fed's semiannual economic report to Congress, Greenspan said increasing the wage probably would push inflation higher.
President Clinton, meanwhile, declined to comment on the issue but told reporters that White House lawyers will testify on the matter next week.
The United States does have a direct interest in whether there is instability in the Balkans," Clinton said.
No shots had been fired and no one was reported hurt, she said.

About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.
Of the 5,743 known species of toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and worm like amphibians, 1,856 (32.5 percent) are under threat, according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries.
The researchers called for efforts to protect the habitat of amphibians and to reproduce the threatened species in captivity.
Climate changes and pollution have been blamed for some of the disappearing species, according to the study published by Science magazine Friday.

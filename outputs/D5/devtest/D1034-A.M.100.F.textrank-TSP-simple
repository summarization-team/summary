Among the species, 122 have completely disappeared since 1980 and scientists fear that hundreds more will become extinct in coming decades.
Climate changes and pollution have been blamed for some of the disappearing species, according to the study published by Science magazine Friday.
The researchers called for efforts to protect the habitat of amphibians and to reproduce the threatened species in captivity.
About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.

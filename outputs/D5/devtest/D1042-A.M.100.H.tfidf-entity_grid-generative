Private Lynndie England, infamous for her role in the Abu Ghraib scandal, pleaded guilty to seven charges related to prisoner abuse.
Defense requested a judge change due to prior involvement in similar cases.
England admitted following orders from her ex-boyfriend, Charles Graner, a ringleader in the abuse.
The case involved graphic photos of humiliation that sparked global outrage.
England, a former records clerk, lacked training as a prison guard.
Despite peer pressure, she acknowledged the wrongfulness of her actions.
The plea deal could reduce her potential sentence from 16.5 to 11 years in prison.

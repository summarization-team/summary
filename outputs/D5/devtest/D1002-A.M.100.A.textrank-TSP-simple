James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client "had a sick feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and he reacted."
We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and pray they get a fair trial," Safir said.
Through their lawyers, the officers have said they thought Diallo had a gun.
McMellon supposedly slipped and fell as he and the other officers confronted Diallo.
Brounstein and Culleton both said their clients began firing because they saw one officer on the ground.

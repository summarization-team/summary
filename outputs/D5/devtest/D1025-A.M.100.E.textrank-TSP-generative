A nine-year study by the University of Calgary revealed that grizzly bears in Banff National Park have the lowest reproductive rate in North America.
The proposal to remove grizzlies from the endangered species list outside Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks has sparked controversy.
While some see it as a success story, others fear it could endanger the bears' critical habitat.
Experts warn that without proper habitat protection, the grizzly population could decline rapidly.
The decision to delist the Yellowstone grizzly bears is seen as a pivotal moment in wildlife conservation efforts, with implications for their long-term survival.

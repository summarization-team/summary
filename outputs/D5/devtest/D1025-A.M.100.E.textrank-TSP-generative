A nine-year study by the University of Calgary revealed that grizzly bears in Banff National Park have the lowest reproductive rate in North America.
Efforts to save female bears have been successful, but the proposal to remove grizzlies from the endangered species list outside Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks is controversial.
Critics fear habitat loss and increased human activity could threaten the bears' survival.
Despite population growth, experts warn that managing grizzlies on a "knife-edge" could lead to their extinction.
The delicate balance of protecting habitat and managing bear populations remains a critical challenge.

SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua)--One out of every ten people in Shanghai is overweight, mostly because of improved lifestyles and poor eating habits.
A recent survey found that 12.6 percent of 4,895 adults and 11.35 percent of 9,093 children who live in urban Shanghai are obese, and these figures are close to the average weight proportion seen in developed countries, it was reported in today's "Wen Hui Bao Daily."

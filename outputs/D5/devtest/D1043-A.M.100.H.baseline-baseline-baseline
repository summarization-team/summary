Opposition leaders on Monday held Lebanese and Syrian governments responsible for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, demanded Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon within the next three months and called on the international community to intervene to help "this captive nation."
We hold the Lebanese authority and the Syrian authority, being the authority of tutelage in Lebanon, responsible for this crime and other similar crimes," said a statement after an opposition meeting held Monday night at the late leader's house in Beirut.

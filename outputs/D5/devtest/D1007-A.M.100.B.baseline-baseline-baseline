HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua)--Hong Kong health authorities are stepping up the hunt for the source of a deadly influenza strain previously found only in birds which has caused a global alert.
The "bird flu" has claimed four victims here, killing two, including a 54-year-old man who died Friday.
At least seven staff who had contact with the victims were experiencing flu-like symptoms, but it was not clear if they had also contracted the H5N1 strain, local health officials said today.

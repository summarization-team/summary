Japanese and US officials are in talks to resume US beef shipments to Japan, the top export market.
Japan, a major importer of US beef, halted imports due to mad cow disease fears in 2003.
The dispute arose from Japan's demand to test all US beef, which the US rejected.
However, Japan now considers exempting cows aged 20 months or younger from screening tests.
Meanwhile, cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, linked to mad cow disease, have been reported in France and Ireland.
The EU is allocating funds to combat animal diseases, including mad cow, to prevent further spread.

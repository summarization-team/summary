Japanese and US officials are in talks to resume US beef shipments to Japan, the top export market.
The ban was imposed due to mad cow disease fears in 2003.
Japan, a major importer of US beef, had required testing for all imports, but now considers exempting cows aged 20 months or younger.
The disease, known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), can be transmitted to humans through infected meat or blood transfusions.
Countries like Bulgaria and Ireland are also grappling with cases of mad cow disease, prompting increased testing and stricter measures to prevent its spread.

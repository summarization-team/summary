Japanese and US officials are in talks to resume US beef shipments to Japan, the top export market.
Japan, a major importer of US beef, halted imports due to mad cow disease fears in 2003.
Japan initially demanded testing for all US beef, but later backed down due to difficulties in detecting the disease in younger cows.
Recent talks suggest exempting cows aged 20 months or younger from screening tests.
Meanwhile, other countries like Bulgaria and Ireland are also grappling with mad cow disease cases.
The EU is allocating funds to combat animal diseases, including mad cow, to prevent further spread.

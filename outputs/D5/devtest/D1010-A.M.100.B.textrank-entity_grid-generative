Talks between Japanese and US officials have begun to resume US beef shipments to Japan, the top export market.
Japan had insisted on testing all US beef imports for mad cow disease, but agreed to exempt cows aged 20 months or younger due to difficulties in detection.
This change is significant as younger cows make up 80% of US beef imports to Japan.
Meanwhile, France reported its eighth case of vCJD, a fatal illness linked to mad cow disease.
In Bulgaria, controversy surrounds the use of a Dutch test for mad cow detection not approved by the EU.

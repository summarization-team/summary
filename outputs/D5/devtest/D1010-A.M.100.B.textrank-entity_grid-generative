Talks between Japanese and US officials have begun to resume US beef shipments to Japan, the top export market.
Japan, the largest importer of US beef, had halted imports due to mad cow disease fears.
However, Japan is now considering exempting cows aged 20 months or younger from screening tests, as they make up 80% of US beef imports.
Meanwhile, France reported its eighth case of human mad cow disease, vCJD, in a blood donor.
In Bulgaria, controversy surrounds the use of a Dutch test for mad cow disease, while Ireland faces its first homegrown case of vCJD.

The trial for one of the men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
Russell Henderson and Aaron James McKinney, both 21, face murder charges and the death penalty if convicted.
Shepard died after a brutal beating in Laramie in October.
Henderson's trial is set for April 6, while McKinney's trial is scheduled for August 9.
The academic community's perception of the death penalty may impact the trial's outcome.
Hate crimes, like Shepard's case, are meant to send a message of terror to various groups.
Despite the attention, only a few spectators were present as Henderson's trial

The trial for one of the men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed to April 6 due to a scheduling conflict.
Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, face murder charges and the death penalty if convicted.
Henderson's trial will start with jury selection on March 24.
The academic community's perception of the death penalty may impact the trial's outcome.
Hate crimes, like Shepard's case, are meant to send a message of terror.
Despite the attention, only a few spectators were present as Henderson's trial began.

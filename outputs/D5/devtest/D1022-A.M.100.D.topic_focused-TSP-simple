Ruddock said Australia was "vigorously opposed "" " to the Japanese proposals and would press its efforts to establish a South Pacific whale sanctuary.
Australia strongly opposes Japanese plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
Ruddock told Sky News that Australian patrol boats could be accused of piracy if they boarded Japanese ships in the area, because of Australia "'s" obligations under the Antarctic Treaty.

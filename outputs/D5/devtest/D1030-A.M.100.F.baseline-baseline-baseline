UNDATED: DUI vs. DWI?
Q: I remember reading some months ago that the Fuller Brush Co., of Fuller Brush Man fame, still exists.
I had assumed that with changing technology and lifestyles, it was long gone.
Do you have any information, and where can I order products?
A: The Fuller Brush Co. is still a booming business.
Although distributors nationwide still may call on customers occasionally, the legendary "brush man" calling door-to-door is little more than a memory, said company spokesman Larry Gray.

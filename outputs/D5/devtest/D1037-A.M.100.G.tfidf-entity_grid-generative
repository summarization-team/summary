The Beck family, three generations strong, set out to harvest disease-free oysters from managed reserves after years of dwindling oyster populations in the Chesapeake Bay.
Watermen, including the Becks, agreed to wait until the oysters reached legal size before harvesting.
With the bay ecosystem in peril due to nonnative species, efforts are underway to introduce Asian oysters.
However, concerns about the impact on native oysters persist.
Despite challenges, initiatives like the Oyster Recovery Partnership aim to restore oyster populations in the bay, offering hope for the future of this vital ecosystem.

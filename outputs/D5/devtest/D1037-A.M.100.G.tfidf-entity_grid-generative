Last weekend, the Beck family, spanning three generations, set out to harvest disease-free oysters from managed reserves in the Chesapeake Bay.
Bill Beck, a seasoned waterman, expressed concerns over the declining oyster population, with last season's haul significantly lower than in previous decades.
The introduction of Asian oysters as a potential solution has sparked debate among experts and officials.
Meanwhile, the Chesapeake Bay faces ongoing challenges, including pollution and dwindling watermen numbers.
Despite efforts to revitalize the bay, the future remains uncertain, with critical decisions on the horizon regarding the bay's ecosystem and sustainability.

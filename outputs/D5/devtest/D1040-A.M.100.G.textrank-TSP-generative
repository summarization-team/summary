During the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, witnesses testified about his desire to keep the baby he had with his slain wife, Bonny Lee Bakley.
The prosecution argued that Blake killed Bakley after failed attempts to solicit others.
Despite lacking concrete evidence linking him to the murder weapon, the prosecution emphasized Blake's suspicious behavior.
Defense attorney Schwartzbach discredited key witnesses, portraying Bakley as a manipulative figure.
The trial, filled with bizarre twists, highlighted Blake's alleged involvement in a murder plot.
Ultimately, the jury must determine Blake's guilt in his wife's death and the solicitation of hitmen.

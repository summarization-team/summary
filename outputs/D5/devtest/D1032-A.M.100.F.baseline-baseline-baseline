More than 160 of 216 people working on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea were evacuated Sunday after one of the rigs became "unstable", causing a loss of output of 130,000 barrels per day, a company spokesman and rescue services said.
The group was evacuated by helicopter from the Snorre A platform which is operated by Norway's Statoil, Terje Largaas, a rescue official at Sola in the southwest of the country, told AFP.

Heinz officials in the United States recalled two batches of baby food due to concerns of high lead levels.
The products, including hot dogs and deli meat, were distributed nationwide and internationally.
Other recalls were made for possible Listeria contamination, urging consumers to return the products.
Listeria, a food-borne pathogen, poses serious health risks, especially to pregnant women and individuals with weakened immune systems.
Recent outbreaks of food-borne illnesses have raised concerns about food safety regulations.
Consumers are advised to thoroughly cook raw animal products and practice proper food handling to prevent contamination.

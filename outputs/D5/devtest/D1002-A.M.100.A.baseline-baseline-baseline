NEW YORK (AP)--Four white police officers were charged with murder Wednesday for killing an unarmed African immigrant in a hail of 41 bullets--a shooting that has led to months of protests and a painful examination of police tactics and race relations.
Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy pleaded innocent in a Bronx courtroom to second-degree murder.
They could get 25 years to life in prison on the murder charges.

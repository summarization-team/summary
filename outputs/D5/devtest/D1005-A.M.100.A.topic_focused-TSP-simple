Bush in 2001 effectively banned further federal funding for the science citing the killing of human embryos that occurs in the process.
Californians voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to become the first US state to fund controversial embryonic stem cell research that was effectively banned by President George W. Bush, US media reported.
They also claim that the measure will make California, already the United States ""' leading hub for biotech industries, a world hub of stem cell research too.

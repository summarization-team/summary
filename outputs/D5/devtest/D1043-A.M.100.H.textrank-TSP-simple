We call upon the international community to shoulder its responsibility toward Lebanon, the captive nation," said the statement, read by legislator Bassem Sabei, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc.
Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
It also called for a three-day strike and demanded an international commission to investigate the assassination "in light of the lack of confidence of the Lebanese in this government."

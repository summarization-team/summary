Five Caribbean islands canceled tropical storm watches Friday night as Floyd, packing winds of 110 mph, moved further out to sea, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
Floyd was expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.
Floyd was expected to intensify, and it was unlikely to hit land soon.
It was too early to tell if the storm would threaten the Bahamas, which lie far north of other Caribbean islands.
The hurricane itself was likely to pass well north of the islands, meteorologists said.

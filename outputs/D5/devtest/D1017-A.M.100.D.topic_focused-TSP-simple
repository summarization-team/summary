THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP)--Hurricane Floyd on Saturday whirred away from the Caribbean "'s" Leeward Islands, but forecasters warned that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be hit by heavy rains and flooding.
Floyd was expected to intensify, and it was unlikely to hit land soon.
Floyd was expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.
The hurricane itself was likely to pass well north of the islands, meteorologists said.

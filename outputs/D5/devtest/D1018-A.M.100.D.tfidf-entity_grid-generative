Three young men partied with an 18-year-old Alabama honors student, Natalee Holloway, before she went missing.
Surinamese brothers Satish and Deepak Kaploe claimed Natalee fell while getting out of the car, and a security guard approached her.
Dutch citizen Joran Van Der Sloot tried to help, but Natalee refused.
The men were arrested in connection with her disappearance.
Despite extensive searches, no one has been charged.
The investigation continues, with suspects including the Kalpoe brothers and Van Der Sloot remaining in custody.
The case has attracted international attention and raised concerns about prisoner treatment at Guantanamo

A devastating tsunami hit Papua New Guinea's coast, leaving at least 70 dead and 300 missing.
The wall of water, reaching 23 feet, struck without warning in the town of Aitape, wiping out villages and displacing thousands.
The death toll is expected to exceed 1,000, with many injured and homeless.
Australia is providing relief supplies and a mobile hospital to assist the victims.
The rough terrain poses challenges for aid delivery, with efforts focused on accessing stricken villages.
The death toll has climbed to 599, with Prime Minister Bill Skate set to assess the situation.

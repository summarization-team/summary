In 2001, President George W. Bush banned federal funding for stem cell research due to ethical concerns.
However, Californians voted to fund embryonic stem cell research, aiming to make California a global hub for this groundbreaking research.
Supporters believe this decision could lead to cures for diseases like cancer, AIDS, and Parkinson's.
The research also sheds light on dopamine's role in learning and addiction.
Additionally, a gene mutation linked to Parkinson's disease has been discovered, offering hope for future treatments.
Overall, the debate surrounding stem cell research continues to evolve, with potential implications for medical advancements.

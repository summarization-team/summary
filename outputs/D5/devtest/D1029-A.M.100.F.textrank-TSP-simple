Thousands of troops moved into the region after a rocket barrage on the gas plant left eight people dead in January.
Tribal rebels attacked a paramilitary convoy in restive southwest Pakistan on Thursday, killing three soldiers and injuring seven others, a senior military officer said.
Earlier corps spokesman Colonel Rizwan Malik said the tribesmen used light and heavy weapons and also rained more than 150 rockets and mortar shells on a nearby military base.
He said regular army troops backed by two military helicopters had been sent to tackle the situation.

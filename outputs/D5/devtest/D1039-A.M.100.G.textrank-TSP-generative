The murder of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh sparked outrage and fears of ethnic tensions in the Netherlands.
Van Gogh, known for his controversial views on Islam, was shot and stabbed while cycling in Amsterdam.
Despite his provocative nature, many condemned the attack as an assault on freedom of speech.
The suspect, with ties to Islamic extremists, was arrested after a shootout with the police.
The killing, reminiscent of the assassination of Pim Fortuyn, led to calls for calm and dialogue among different communities.
The tragic event highlighted the delicate balance between freedom of expression and religious sensitivities.

The poisoning of Ukrainian opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with dioxin has sparked a political crisis, with Yushchenko accusing the government of trying to kill him.
Doctors confirmed the poisoning, which caused disfigurement and severe illness.
Yushchenko, a pro-Western candidate, faces Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych in a repeat election.
The US denied supporting any specific candidate in Ukraine's election but emphasized its commitment to promoting democracy.
The poisoning incident has raised concerns about political interference and the need for a thorough investigation to ensure free and fair elections.

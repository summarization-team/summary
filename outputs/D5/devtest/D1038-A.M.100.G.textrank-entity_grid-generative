The eruption at Mount St. Helens, following a week of earthquakes, sparked concerns of a more powerful event.
Experts warned of potential future eruptions based on historical patterns.
The recent activity, including a steam cloud from the crater, led to evacuations and heightened alert levels.
Despite similarities to past eruptions, scientists do not anticipate a catastrophe like the deadly 1980 event.
The short-lived eruption released steam and ash, with no immediate threat.
Monitoring instruments detected decreased seismic activity post-eruption, indicating temporary relief.
Scientists predict a larger eruption soon but not on the scale of previous disasters.

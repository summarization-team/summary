More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
Once again, human impacts are to blame for the depletion of reefs," the union said in a statement, adding that climate change and the encroachment of introduced species such as starfish were also major factors.

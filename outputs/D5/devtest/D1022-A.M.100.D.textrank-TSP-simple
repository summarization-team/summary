Ruddock told Sky News that Australian patrol boats could be accused of piracy if they boarded Japanese ships in the area, because of Australia's obligations under the Antarctic Treaty.
Australia strongly opposes Japanese plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
But the government opposes an application in Australia's Federal Court to prevent a Japanese whaling company entering the Australian-declared whale sanctuary in Antarctica, which Japan does not recognise.

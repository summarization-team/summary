McClellan also denied anew that US money that went to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Ukraine ended up supporting the Western-leaning Yushchenko directly.
I know the Ukraine government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," the spokesman said after doctors at the clinic confirmed for the first time that Yushchenko had swallowed relatively large amounts of dioxin.
The White House Monday urged Ukraine to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.

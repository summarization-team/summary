The White House Monday urged Ukraine to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
Asked whether he was sure that no US assistance ended up directly helping Yushchenko, McClellan replied: "Yes."
McClellan also denied anew that US money that went to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Ukraine ended up supporting the Western-leaning Yushchenko directly.
We do not and have not supported any particular candidate in Ukraine's presidential election," he said.

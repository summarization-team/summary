THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP)--Hurricane Floyd on Saturday whirred away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands, but forecasters warned that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be hit by heavy rains and flooding.
The hurricane itself was likely to pass well north of the islands, meteorologists said.
Floyd was expected to intensify, and it was unlikely to hit land soon.
It posed no immediate threat to the United States coast.
Still, it was recommended that people along the U.S. southeast monitor the storm's course this weekend.

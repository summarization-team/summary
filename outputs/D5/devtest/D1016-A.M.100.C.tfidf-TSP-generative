Former President Soeharto of Indonesia, facing allegations of amassing a vast fortune through corrupt means, has been under intense scrutiny.
With ventures totaling over $15 billion, calls have been made for him to donate his wealth to the state.
Despite denying any foreign bank accounts, investigations into his overseas assets continue.
The Attorney General has formed a team to probe Soeharto's wealth, with a focus on recovering state assets allegedly stashed abroad.
Amid mounting pressure, legislators have agreed to investigate Soeharto's wealth, uncovering evidence of ill-gotten gains in various provinces.

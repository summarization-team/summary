Former Indonesian President Soeharto, facing investigations into his alleged ill-gotten wealth, has denied having any foreign bank accounts.
The Attorney General's office is determined to hunt down state assets stashed abroad during his 32-year rule.
Soeharto's family fortune, including stocks, land, and factories, is under scrutiny.
Calls for a thorough probe into his wealth have led to mass demonstrations in Jakarta.
Despite his age, forgiveness may be considered for Soeharto, but his children and cronies could face legal consequences if found guilty of corruption.
The investigation team continues to uncover evidence of his questionable wealth.

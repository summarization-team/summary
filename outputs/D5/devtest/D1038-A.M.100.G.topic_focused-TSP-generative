Scientists rushed to assess Mount St. Helens after a small explosive eruption, confirming no lava or mud flows.
The eruption, as predicted, lasted 24 minutes, generating a steam and ash plume.
Despite increased seismic activity, experts believe the threat is localized.
Tourists were evacuated, and officials warned of potential ash inhalation risks.
While a more powerful eruption is anticipated, scientists remain uncertain about the volcano's future behavior.
The recent activity, reminiscent of past eruptions, has reignited interest in the volcano's unpredictable nature.

Scientists rushed to assess if Mount St. Helens, known for its deadly eruptions, was gearing up for another blast.
A recent small explosive eruption, lasting 24 minutes, emitted steam and ash but posed no major threat.
Despite the eruption being as predicted, experts warned of a potential larger eruption.
The volcano alert level was raised, indicating imminent danger.
Tourists were evacuated, and scientists monitored the situation closely.
While uncertainties remain about future eruptions, the recent activity has reignited fears of a catastrophic event similar to the 1980 eruption.

President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Roh asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case, his spokesman Kim Man-Soo said.
It is shameful and deplorable that a state organization was involved in illegal wiretapping," Roh was quoted as saying.

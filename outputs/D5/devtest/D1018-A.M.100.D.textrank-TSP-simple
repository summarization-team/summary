At that moment, the Surinamese brothers told police, a black man dressed in a black security uniform and carrying a Walkie-Talkie went up to Natalee, seemingly to offer his assistance.
The suspects then drove off, and did not see Natalie again, they told police, according to the source.
Two of the suspects, identified as Surinamese brothers Satish and Deepak Kaploe, told police Natalee had been drinking and fell down as she got of the car in front of the hotel, the source told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

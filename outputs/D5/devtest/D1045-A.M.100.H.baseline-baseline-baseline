A top official with China's environmental watchdog said Thursday that the company overseeing a chemical plant where an explosion spewed lethal chemicals into a river in the country's northeast should be held responsible for the pollution.
The Nov. 13 blast in Jilin, a city in Jilin province, caused massive amounts of benzene, a toxic, flammable liquid to flow into the Songhua River.
The 80-kilometer-long (50-mile-long) swathe of chemicals moved downstream into Harbin, a city of 3.8 million people in neighboring Heilongjiang province, on Thursday, prompting officials to shut down water supplies.

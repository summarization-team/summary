LaFave was arrested in June and suspended from her job until the trial is over.
LaFave will plead not guilty by reason of insanity to avoid a trial scheduled for next year, according to her attorney.
Prosecutors released Thursday photographs and secretly recorded tapes to support their accusation that Debra LaFave, formerly a schoolteacher, had sex with a 14-year-old student.
Prosecutors released photographs taken in a department store where they said the teacher had taken the youth, supposedly the day his relatives began to suspect that there was something between the two.

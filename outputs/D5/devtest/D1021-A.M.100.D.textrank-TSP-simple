The prosecutors said they have seven such tape recordings.
The tapes, broadcast over local television, recorded LaFave, 24, arranging an encounter with the youth, while expressing concern that he not lie to his mother, Tampa prosecutors said.
LaFave was arrested in June and suspended from her job until the trial is over.
LaFave will plead not guilty by reason of insanity to avoid a trial scheduled for next year, according to her attorney.
She faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty on all charges.

Genetic evidence indicates that pygmy-like people with dark skin and tightly curled hair have inhabited the Andamans for over 60,000 years.
Five tribes, totaling 989 individuals, survived the recent tsunami, including the Onge, Sentinelese, Andamanese, Jarawa, and Shompen.
The Onge tribe faces territorial loss due to government development projects.
The devastation caused by the tsunami has impacted marine life and coastal ecosystems.
Mangroves and coral reefs play a crucial role in protecting coastal areas from such disasters.
Efforts are being made to restore damaged mangrove forests and promote sustainable development in affected regions.

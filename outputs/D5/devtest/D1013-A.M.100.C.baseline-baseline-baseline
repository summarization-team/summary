WASHINGTON (AP)--Although the IRS is making some progress, a new audit says chronic computer system weaknesses continue to place sensitive taxpayer data at risk of theft, fraud and even misuse by hackers.
They still have a long way to go," said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
Personal information on IRS computers is at risk to unauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification, and most alarmingly, to identity theft," Thompson said Tuesday.
The audit by the congressional General Accounting Office of six IRS facilities, also found that 397 computer tapes containing taxpayer information had been lost.

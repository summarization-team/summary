South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called for a probe into illegal recordings involving the ambassador to the US and a Samsung executive in 1997.
The scandal led to the resignation of the ambassador amid suspicions of involvement in a political slush fund scandal.
The National Intelligence Service was urged to investigate the case thoroughly.
The recordings revealed discussions about illicit donations to politicians, sparking widespread corruption scandals.
The spy agency apologized for illegal wiretapping activities, causing public outrage and concerns about civil liberties.
The scandal tarnished the legacy of former President Kim Dae-jung, leading to hospitalization due to health issues.

Vietnam has launched a support fund for victims of war-era defoliant, focusing on areas with high rates of birth defects and cancers.
The Red Cross initiated the fund, aiming to address the lingering impact of dioxin exposure.
Despite ongoing research, conclusive evidence linking herbicides to certain illnesses remains elusive.
The Vietnamese government plans a nationwide census to identify Agent Orange victims, particularly in central and northern regions.
Efforts to study the herbicides' effects are hindered by limited data and conflicting research methodologies.
The legacy of Agent Orange continues to affect generations, underscoring the need for comprehensive support and research collaboration.

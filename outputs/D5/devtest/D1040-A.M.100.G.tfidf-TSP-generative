The final day of Robert Blake's defense case featured his daughter, Delinah Blake-Hurwitz, testifying about adopting Rosie, a child he loved.
Witnesses described his anxiety over Bakley's pregnancy and desire to keep Rosie away from her.
Blake, 71, did not take the stand but shared his story in a TV interview.
Prosecutors argued he killed Bakley due to her con artist ways.
Both sides agree Blake married Bakley for Rosie but disagree on his involvement in her death.
The trial showcased a cast of eccentric characters, from stuntmen to grifters, in a real-life pulp novel drama.

Angry relatives swarmed the counters at Larnaca airport, hurling curses at the managers of an airline whose plane crashed in Greece earlier Sunday, killing all passengers and crew on board.
Greek fire chief Christos Smetis said there were no survivors among the 115 passengers and six crew on board the plane.
Greek state television quoted Cyprus Transport Minister Haris Thrasou as saying the plane had problems with decompression in the past.

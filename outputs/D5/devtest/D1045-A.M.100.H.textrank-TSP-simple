We will be very clear about who's responsible," Zhang Lijun, deputy director of the State Environmental Protection Administration, said at a press conference.
A top official with China's environmental watchdog said Thursday that the company overseeing a chemical plant where an explosion spewed lethal chemicals into a river in the country's northeast should be held responsible for the pollution.
The plant was run by the Jilin Petroleum and Chemical Company, which is under the state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. _ the country's largest oil company.

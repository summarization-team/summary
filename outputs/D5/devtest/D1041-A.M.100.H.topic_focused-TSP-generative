The World Conservation Union issued a warning about the dire state of coral reefs, attributing their endangerment to human activities like pollution and overfishing.
The impact extends to over one billion people who rely on reefs for their livelihoods.
Climate change and the invasion of species like starfish exacerbate the situation.
The destruction of reefs could lead to severe ecosystem effects, with recovery taking decades.
Efforts to create artificial reefs from discarded materials aim to mitigate the damage, but the urgency to address threats like global warming, pollution, and overfishing remains critical for the survival of these vital marine ecosystems.

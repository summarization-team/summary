The World Conservation Union issued a warning about the dire state of coral reefs, attributing their depletion to human activities like pollution and overfishing.
They highlighted the impact on over one billion people and emphasized the need for urgent action.
The destruction of reefs is also linked to climate change and the invasion of species like starfish.
The IUCN plans to release a detailed report on the situation, with experts predicting severe ecosystem effects and a recovery process that could span decades.
The threats facing coral reefs are multifaceted, including global warming, pollution, and overfishing, posing a significant risk to marine life and biodiversity.

The World Conservation Union issued a warning about the dire state of coral reefs, attributing their depletion to human activities like pollution and overfishing.
With more than half of the world's coral reefs endangered, the impact on marine ecosystems and over one billion people is significant.
The destruction of reefs could take decades to reverse, with threats including climate change, coral disease, and pollution runoff.
Efforts to create artificial reefs from discarded materials aim to conserve fishery resources, but challenges persist, such as the wreckage of sunken ships harming coral growth.
The recent tsunami further devastated marine life, highlighting the urgent need for conservation measures.

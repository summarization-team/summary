The murder of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, a descendant of Vincent van Gogh, sparked outrage in the Netherlands.
Van Gogh, known for his controversial film "Submission" about Islam and women, was shot and stabbed while cycling in Amsterdam.
His collaboration with politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a vocal critic of Islamic culture, led to death threats.
The suspect, with ties to extremist Muslims, triggered concerns about societal divisions.
Despite condemnation from Muslim organizations, the brutal killing raised questions about Dutch tolerance.
Van Gogh's unwavering defense of free speech and criticism of Islam left a lasting impact on Dutch society.

Van Gogh, known for his controversial film "Submission" about Islam and women, was shot and stabbed while cycling in Amsterdam.
His collaboration with politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a vocal critic of Islamic culture, led to death threats.
The suspect, with ties to extremist Muslims, triggered concerns about societal divisions.
Van Gogh's brutal killing highlighted the country's waning tolerance.
Despite his polarizing views, he was hailed as a champion of free speech, mourned by thousands at a memorial gathering.

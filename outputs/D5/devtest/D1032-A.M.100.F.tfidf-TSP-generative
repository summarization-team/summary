A gas leak on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea led to the evacuation of 160 workers and a loss of 130,000 barrels per day.
Statoil, the operator, is working to seal off the leak and resume production.
The incident caused a 4% reduction in Norway's daily oil production.
Statoil hopes to restart the platform soon, pending approval from the Petroleum Safety Authority.
The shutdown also affected other oil companies in the region, with production cuts due to gas leaks and equipment damage.
Weather conditions have further delayed operations, impacting the nation's oil output.

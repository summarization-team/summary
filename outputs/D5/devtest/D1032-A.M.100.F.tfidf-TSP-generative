A gas leak on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea led to the evacuation of 160 workers and a loss of 130,000 barrels per day.
Statoil, the operator, is working to seal the leak and resume production.
The incident caused a 4% reduction in Norway's daily oil production.
Statoil hopes to restart the platform by the end of the month, pending safety approvals.
The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority is closely monitoring the situation and awaiting further information before allowing full production to resume.
Other oil companies in the region also faced production challenges due to gas leaks and weather conditions.

The Snorre oil field where the Snorre A and Snorre B platforms are located produces a total 238,000 barrels per day, according to the Statoil website.
More than 160 of 216 people working on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea were evacuated Sunday after one of the rigs became "unstable", causing a loss of output of 130,000 barrels per day, a company spokesman and rescue services said.
It means that we lost control of the pressure in one of the rigs," after a gas leak around 7:00 pm (1800 GMT), he said.

President Roh of South Korea has called for a thorough investigation by the National Intelligence Service into a major corruption scandal involving illicit funds donated to political parties.
The scandal implicates a Samsung executive and numerous lawmakers and aides.
The country was previously rocked by corruption scandals, with suspicions of illegal donations during the 2002 presidential poll.
The envoy to the United States offered his resignation amidst the scandal, while the spy agency publicly apologized for illegal wiretapping activities.
President Roh accepted the resignation, signaling a significant development in the ongoing political turmoil.

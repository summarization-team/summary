Floyd was expected to intensify, and it was unlikely to hit land soon.
The hurricane itself was likely to pass well north of the islands, meteorologists said.
It was too early to tell if the storm would threaten the Bahamas, which lie far north of other Caribbean islands.
Still, it was recommended that people along the U.S. southeast monitor the storm's course this weekend.
But it's not going to threaten any land anywhere over the weekend," said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center.

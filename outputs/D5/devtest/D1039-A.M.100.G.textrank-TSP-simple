Moroccan organisations in The Netherlands condemned the murder and called for calm.
Many commentators in the Netherlands immediately drew parallels between the murder of Van Gogh and the assassination of Fortuyn on May 6, 2002.
After the film was shown on Dutch television in August, Van Gogh received death threats and police stepped up measures to protect him, much against his will.
Van Gogh himself had said in an interview with Dutch public radio on Friday that he "could not imagine" that anyone would want to harm him.

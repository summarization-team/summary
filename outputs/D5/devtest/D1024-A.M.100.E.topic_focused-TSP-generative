President Omar el-Bashir of Sudan condemned the U.S. missile strikes on a pharmaceutical factory, denying any link to chemical weapons production.
The Arab League criticized the attacks, while the U.S. defended its actions as self-defense.
Diplomats from various nations expressed concern over the violation of international law.
El-Bashir invited an American verification committee to inspect the factory.
Despite conflicting claims, the factory's purpose remains disputed, with some believing it was used for pharmaceuticals and others suspecting it was a front for chemical weapons.

A gas leak on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea led to the evacuation of 160 out of 216 workers.
Production loss of 130,000 barrels per day occurred due to rig instability.
Statoil is working to stabilize the situation and seal the leak to resume production.
The gas leak, considered serious, originated from an injection well.
Statoil aims to gradually resume production on two platforms, with a target of 100,000 barrels per day in the short term.
The shutdown has impacted Norway's oil production, with efforts ongoing to secure the well and obtain regulatory approval for production resumption.

A gas leak on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea led to the evacuation of 160 out of 216 workers.
The incident caused a loss of 130,000 barrels per day in production.
Statoil is working to stabilize the situation and seal off the leak to resume production.
The gas leak, deemed "unusual and serious," originated from an injection well.
Production on two platforms remains suspended, reducing Norway's oil output by 200,000 barrels per day.
Statoil aims to gradually resume production, with repairs ongoing to address the gas leak issue.
Royal Dutch/Shell Group also faced production challenges due to damaged equipment.

The investigation into JonBenet Ramsey's murder in Boulder, Colo., has cost over $1 million.
District Attorney Alex Hunter requested public assistance in identifying a stuffed bear found in JonBenet's room.
The Ramseys cooperated with the grand jury, despite past reluctance.
Special prosecutors were appointed due to criticism of Hunter's handling of the case.
Detective Lou Smit resigned, believing the Ramseys were innocent.
The investigation continues, with DNA samples taken from the Ramseys' extended family.
Critics question the effectiveness of the investigation, with some calling for a special prosecutor to take over.

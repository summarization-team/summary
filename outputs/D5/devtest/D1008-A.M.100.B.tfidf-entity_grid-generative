The Beck family, three generations strong, set out to harvest disease-free oysters from managed reserves after years of waiting for them to grow to legal size.
Oyster harvests in the Chesapeake Bay have dwindled drastically, leading to frustration among watermen and environmental groups.
Efforts to clean up the bay face challenges, including the invasive nutria species and the introduction of Asian oysters.
Despite setbacks, there are ongoing initiatives to restore the bay's health, such as the Oyster Recovery Partnership's planting of disease-free oyster seeds.
The future of the bay remains uncertain, with continued efforts needed for its preservation.

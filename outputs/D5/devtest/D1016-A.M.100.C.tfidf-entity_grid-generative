Former President Soeharto, facing allegations of amassing billions illegally, has pledged to donate 95% of his wealth to the state.
Indonesian Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro is leading an investigation into the wealth of former officials, including Soeharto and his family.
Amid mounting pressure, Soeharto resigned after 32 years of rule, prompting calls for accountability.
Demonstrations demanding justice for corruption, collusion, and nepotism have erupted, with evidence of ill-gotten wealth surfacing.
While forgiveness is considered for Soeharto due to his age, accountability is sought for his children and associates.

The Chesapeake Bay's native oysters have been decimated by over-harvesting and disease, with last season's haul a mere fraction of what it was three decades ago.
Watermen have agreed to avoid harvesting in managed reserves until oysters reach legal size.
Concerns arise over introducing disease-resistant Asian oysters, potentially squeezing out native species.
Efforts to clean up the bay are faltering, with political leaders calling for major changes.
The Susquehanna River, a major source of fresh water for the bay, is endangered due to pollution.
Despite challenges, oyster season traditions persist in Chesapeake communities.

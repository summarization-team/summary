A more extensive report is expected later this spring examining the grizzly populations in Alberta's less protected Eastern Slopes.
Researchers believe at least one female grizzly a year has been saved by the measures.
So the death of a single bear can have a significant impact on population trends.
Basically, we (need) to have 19 out of 20 adult female bears in their reproductive years to survive into the next year," said Stephen Herrero, an environmental scientist at the University of Calgary and co-author of the study.

Basically, we (need) to have 19 out of 20 adult female bears in their reproductive years to survive into the next year," said Stephen Herrero, an environmental scientist at the University of Calgary and co-author of the study.
A nine-year study coinciding with burgeoning development in and around Banff National Park has found the area's grizzly bears have the lowest reproductive rate ever recorded in North America, scientists at the University of Calgary said.
A more extensive report is expected later this spring examining the grizzly populations in Alberta's less protected Eastern Slopes.

Authorities have stated that Patsy and John Ramsey are the focus of the investigation into the murder of their daughter, JonBenet, who was found beaten and strangled in her home in Boulder.
The grand jury, funded with $80,000, has been meeting in secret since mid-September.
A white bear dressed as Santa Claus has emerged as a clue in the case, with investigators seeking information on its origin.
The Ramseys, who have been cooperative with prosecutors, have faced criticism for their handling of the investigation, leading to calls for a special prosecutor to take over.

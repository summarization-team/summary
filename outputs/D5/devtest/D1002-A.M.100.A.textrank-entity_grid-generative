Four police officers are ordered to stand trial for the shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant, Amadou Diallo.
The officers believed Diallo had a gun, leading to the fatal shooting.
The officers did not testify before the grand jury, which indicted them for second-degree murder.
Diallo's parents express satisfaction with the indictments.
Defense lawyers argue the officers had reasonable cause to believe Diallo was armed.
Forensic evidence will play a crucial role in the trial, challenging the officers' credibility.
The trial is scheduled for January, with potential motions and hearings to follow.
The case involves complex legal and ethical considerations surrounding police conduct and accountability.

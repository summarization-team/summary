President Roh Moo-Hyun has called for an inquiry into illegal wiretapping allegations involving South Korea's ambassador to the US and a Samsung executive.
The country faced corruption scandals after businesses made illicit donations to politicians in 2002.
Samsung was accused of providing slush funds to political parties, leading to arrests of lawmakers and aides.
The former intelligence official leaked a taped conversation, prompting an arrest warrant.
President Roh accepted the ambassador's resignation amid the scandal.
The National Intelligence Service apologized for illegal wiretapping, tarnishing former President Kim Dae-jung's legacy.
Samsung Group may take legal action against media outlets for their coverage.

President Roh Moo-Hyun called for a probe into illegal wiretapping of conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the US and a Samsung executive.
This follows corruption scandals involving illicit donations by businesses to politicians during the 2002 presidential poll.
The scandal implicates Samsung in providing slush funds to politicians, leading to arrests and resignations.
The National Intelligence Service apologized for ongoing wiretapping, even after orders to cease in 1998.
President Kim Dae-jung's legacy is marred by the scandal, denying knowledge of the wiretapping.
The investigation continues, with Samsung considering legal action against media outlets.

A gas leak on the Snorre A platform in the North Sea led to the evacuation of 160 workers, causing a loss of 130,000 barrels per day.
Statoil, Norway's third-largest crude exporter, faced production challenges.
The incident was described as serious, with ongoing evacuation efforts.
Statoil sought permission to gradually resume production, aiming for 100,000 barrels per day.
The shutdown did not impact oil exports, and efforts to seal the well were underway.
Despite challenges, Statoil aimed to restart operations by the end of the month, ensuring safety and environmental protection.

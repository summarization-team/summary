A gas leak on the Snorre A platform in the North Sea led to the evacuation of 160 workers, causing a loss of 130,000 barrels per day.
Statoil, Norway's oil giant, faced production challenges, impacting its daily output.
The incident, described as serious, required immediate evacuation and ongoing efforts to resume operations.
The neighboring Snorre B platform remained unaffected, but Statoil's production halt incurred significant financial losses.
With uncertainties surrounding the gas leak's resolution, Statoil sought approval to gradually resume production, aiming to mitigate the impact on Norway's oil exports.

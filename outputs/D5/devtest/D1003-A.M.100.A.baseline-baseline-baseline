China will soon finish building its first blood bank for pandas, which will assist researchers in studying the endangered animals "'" blood types and chances of accepting blood transfusions, state media said Friday.
The bank at southwest China's Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre in the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan province will be completed this year, the China Daily said.
Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources said.

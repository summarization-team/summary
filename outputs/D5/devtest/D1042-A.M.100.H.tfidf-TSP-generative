Defense lawyer Rick Hernandez requested the military judge, Colonel James Pohl, to step down due to presiding over previous Abu Ghraib abuse cases.
Pohl expressed frustration, stating he'd need to see impropriety from two colonels and two three-star generals to recuse himself.
Hernandez argued that England's guilty plea would simplify the case.
The defense demanded a new judge for Private Lynndie England's court martial, known for the infamous Abu Ghraib leash photo.
England admitted to following orders from her ex-boyfriend, Specialist Charles Graner, in the abuse scandal.
She pleaded guilty to seven charges related to mistreating Iraqi prisoners

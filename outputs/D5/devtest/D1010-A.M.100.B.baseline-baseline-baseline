Japanese and US officials began talks Thursday on resuming US beef shipments to top export market Japan, banned last year over mad cow disease fears, amid signs of a resolution to the dispute.
The two-day talks, the fourth round since the ban was imposed in December, come after two Japanese ministries last week recommended exempting cows aged 20 months or younger from screening tests.

Years of paltry oyster harvests have left Bill Beck, a waterman on Maryland's Eastern Shore for 21 of his 39 years, wondering if the business will exist by the time his 9-year-old son reaches adulthood.
Harvesting oysters, crabs or rockfish for 10 to 15 hours a day earns Beck just $25,000 a year.
The dwindling supply of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay--last season's haul was about 24,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of what it was three decades ago--has hurt him the most.
It's getting worse.
There's no oysters.

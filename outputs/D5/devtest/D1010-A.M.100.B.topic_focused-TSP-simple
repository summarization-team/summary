Japan has screened every cow slaughtered for consumption after confirming mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in its own herd in September 2001.
Japan, the largest export market for US beef, is among about three dozen countries that halted US beef imports after mad cow disease was discovered there in December 2003.
Japanese and US officials began talks Thursday on resuming US beef shipments to top export market Japan, banned last year over mad cow disease fears, amid signs of a resolution to the dispute.

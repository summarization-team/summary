Three young men partying with an 18-year-old student in Aruba recounted a man in a security uniform approaching her at her hotel.
When the Dutch citizen suspect tried to assist her, she declined, asserting her independence.
Despite extensive searches, no one has been charged in the case.
The student's family identified the suspects before the police.
Additional arrests are anticipated.
The ongoing investigation includes questioning witnesses and searching various locations.
The disappearance of the Alabama teen continues to puzzle authorities, tarnishing Aruba's reputation as a safe destination.
The involvement of a new suspect, Steve Croes, adds complexity to the case.

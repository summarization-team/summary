Three young men partying with an 18-year-old student from Alabama before her disappearance in Aruba recounted a man in a security uniform approaching her at her hotel.
When the Dutch suspect tried to help, she declined, asserting her independence.
The student's family identified the suspects before the police, leading to their detention.
Despite extensive searches, no charges have been filed.
The ongoing investigation includes questioning witnesses and searching for evidence.
The case has tarnished Aruba's reputation as a safe destination, with no clear resolution in sight.
The community remains distressed over the unresolved disappearance.

The trial for one of the men accused in the beating death of Matthew Shepard has been postponed to August 9.
Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, face murder charges and the death penalty if convicted.
The attack was motivated by Shepard's sexual orientation.
Hate crime legislation is being pushed by Judy Shepard and others to deter such violence.
Henderson and McKinney posed as homosexuals to lure Shepard, leading to demands for stronger laws.
The trial is expected to last five weeks, with Henderson being a witness to the brutal attack.
Both men face serious charges in a case that has sparked national attention.

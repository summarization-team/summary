The trial for one of the men accused in the beating death of Matthew Shepard has been postponed to August 9.
Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, face murder charges and the death penalty if convicted.
The attack was motivated by Shepard's sexual orientation.
Hate crime legislation is being pushed by Judy Shepard and others to deter such violence.
Henderson's trial was delayed due to a scheduling conflict.
The trial is expected to last five weeks, with opening statements set for April 6.
Henderson witnessed the brutal attack on Shepard, with both defendants facing serious charges.

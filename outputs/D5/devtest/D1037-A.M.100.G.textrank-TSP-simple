While watermen have been able to harvest oysters elsewhere, they agreed not to harvest in the managed reserves for several years until the majority of the oysters grew to four inches, one inch bigger than the state's legal size.
Those oysters command a higher price and have a better chance of reproducing, organizers said.
The managed reserve method is "the beginning of a new approach to managing oysters and oyster disease," said Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
Organizers would try to determine how to ensure that oystermen take home a bigger haul before the next harvesting, Egge said.

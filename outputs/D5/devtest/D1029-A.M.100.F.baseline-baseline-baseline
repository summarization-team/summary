Tribal rebels attacked a paramilitary convoy in restive southwest Pakistan on Thursday, killing three soldiers and injuring seven others, a senior military officer said.
Gunbattles between the renegade clansmen and troops from Pakistan's Frontier Corps continued throughout the day after the attack in Baluchistan province, corps chief Major General Shujjat Zamir Dar told reporters.
He described the rebels "'" claims that up to 50 tribesmen had been killed in the exchange of fire as "exaggerated" but said there had been some casualties.

the "Real ID Act" would overturn laws in nine states that allow illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses .
supporters say it would stop foreign terrorists from obtaining licenses that could be used to travel in the u.s. opponents say it could push more immigrants to obtain passports if states don't comply .
the bill is expected to be approved or rejected by house and Senate negotiators .

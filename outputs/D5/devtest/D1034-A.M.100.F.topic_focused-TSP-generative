Researchers warn that one third of amphibians are at risk of extinction, with 122 species already vanished since 1980.
The decline is most severe in tropical regions of Central and South America due to new diseases.
Efforts to protect habitats and breed endangered species are crucial.
Despite challenges, conservation projects like the Frog Decline Reversal Project strive to save these creatures.
Additionally, the impact of pesticides and industrial chemicals on amphibians' reproductive health is a growing concern.
Urgent action is needed to prevent further losses in this vital ecosystem.

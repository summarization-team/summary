Researchers have found that one third of amphibians are at risk of extinction, with 122 species already gone since 1980.
The main threats are habitat loss and new diseases, particularly in tropical regions.
Efforts to protect amphibians are crucial, but funding is lacking, especially for less iconic species like frogs.
In the US, habitat destruction is a major concern, putting over 3,000 species at risk.
The decline in amphibians is alarming, outpacing that of mammals and birds.
Chemical contaminants like DDT have also contributed to their decline, affecting their reproductive health.

Researchers have found that one third of amphibians are at risk of extinction, with 122 species already gone since 1980.
The decline is most severe in tropical regions of Central and South America.
Efforts are needed to protect habitats and breed threatened species in captivity.
The global threat to amphibians is due to various factors like deforestation, pollution, and climate change.
Scientists are concerned about the rapid decline, which surpasses that of mammals and birds.
The situation is exacerbated by the spread of diseases and contaminants affecting their populations.

Debra LaFave, a former schoolteacher, was arrested and suspended pending trial.
She plans to plead insanity to avoid a trial next year.
Prosecutors released evidence of her alleged sexual relationship with a 14-year-old student.
LaFave's ex-husband mentioned her mental health issues.
The victim's family expressed a desire to move on.
Despite a plea deal, concerns remain about LaFave's future as a registered sex offender.
Media attention has intensified the case, raising questions about the role of the press in legal proceedings.
The impact of being labeled a sex offender will linger for years.

Former President Soeharto's wealth is under investigation by Indonesian officials, including Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro.
The investigation covers senior officials, with a focus on the Soeharto family's accumulated wealth.
Soeharto, who resigned amid public pressure, is urged by Indonesian Moslem leader Amien Rais to donate his wealth to the nation.
The government is determined to investigate Soeharto's assets, with a special team scheduled to meet him.
Calls for accountability extend to Soeharto's children and cronies, with demands for legal action and asset seizure.

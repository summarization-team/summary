A blood bank can also simplify the process of breeding pandas because data on the pandas "'" blood types and DNA information will be readily available to bring more diversity to the gene pool.
China will soon finish building its first blood bank for pandas, which will assist researchers in studying the endangered animals "'" blood types and chances of accepting blood transfusions, state media said Friday.
Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources said.

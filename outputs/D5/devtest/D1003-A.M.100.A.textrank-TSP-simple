Initial studies have found that pandas have different blood types, but researchers have not conducted in-depth studies and lack sufficient knowledge about this, centre deputy chief engineer Huang Yan said.
Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources said.
China will soon finish building its first blood bank for pandas, which will assist researchers in studying the endangered animals "'" blood types and chances of accepting blood transfusions, state media said Friday.

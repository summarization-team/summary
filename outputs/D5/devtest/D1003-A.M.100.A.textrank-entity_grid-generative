China is completing its first blood bank for pandas to aid in studying their blood types and transfusion compatibility.
With 163 pandas in captivity, researchers aim to understand the diversity of blood types and DNA to enhance breeding efforts.
The Qinling pandas, separated from the giant panda 50,000 years ago, face threats from habitat loss and food scarcity.
Efforts to protect the endangered species include establishing nature reserves and banning poaching.
Despite challenges like bamboo blooming and inbreeding, conservation initiatives aim to ensure the survival of the beloved giant panda population in China.

China is close to completing its first blood bank for pandas, aiding in research on their blood types and transfusion compatibility.
With 163 giant pandas in captivity, the bank will provide crucial data for breeding and genetic diversity.
The Qinling pandas, separated from the main species 50,000 years ago, are receiving urgent protection efforts due to their dwindling numbers.
Threats like bamboo shortages and poaching continue to endanger the species, prompting conservation measures such as habitat restoration and rescue teams.
Efforts to protect the iconic giant panda include establishing nature reserves and banning poaching, with a focus on afforestation in their habitats.

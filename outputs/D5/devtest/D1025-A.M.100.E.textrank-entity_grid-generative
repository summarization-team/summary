Grizzly bears in and around Banff National Park are facing a reproductive crisis, with the lowest rates ever recorded in North America.
Efforts to save the bears have been successful, leading to a proposal to remove them from the endangered species list.
However, concerns remain about habitat protection and potential threats from human activities.
The delicate balance of managing this vulnerable species is crucial for their long-term survival.
The decision to delist the Yellowstone grizzly bears is met with mixed reactions, highlighting the complexities of wildlife conservation and the ongoing challenges of protecting endangered species.

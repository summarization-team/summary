Grizzly bears in and around Banff National Park are facing a reproductive crisis, with the lowest rates ever recorded in North America.
Efforts to save the bears have been successful, leading to a proposal to remove them from the endangered species list.
However, concerns remain about habitat protection and potential threats from human activities.
The decision to delist the bears is met with mixed reactions, with some fearing the consequences of reduced protections.
The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears hangs in the balance, highlighting the challenges of balancing conservation with development.

About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.
But some are threatened for no apparent reason, according to researchers who carried out the three year Global Amphibian Assessment.
Climate changes and pollution have been blamed for some of the disappearing species, according to the study published by Science magazine Friday.
Of the 5,743 known species of toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and worm like amphibians, 1,856 (32.5 percent) are under threat, according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries.

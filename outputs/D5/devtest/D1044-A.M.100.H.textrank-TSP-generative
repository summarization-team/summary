The Food Standards Agency in Britain has issued a recall of over 350 food products due to the presence of a cancer-causing dye called Sudan I.
The affected items include ready-made meals like shepherd's pie and pasta bake.
The dye was found in a batch of chilli powder used to make Worcester sauce, which was then used in a wide range of products.
The agency is working with supermarkets to remove these products from shelves and advises the public to return them for a refund.
The investigation into this contamination involves multiple local authorities and has sparked international concern.

The Food Standards Agency in Britain has issued a recall of over 350 food products due to the presence of a potentially cancer-causing dye called Sudan I.
The dye was found in a batch of chilli powder used in various food items, prompting a widespread investigation.
The affected products include ready-made meals, sauces, and other items sold in supermarkets.
Consumers are advised to return these products for a refund and avoid consuming them.
The contamination has sparked international concern, with other European countries taking precautions to prevent the spread of the tainted products.
Sudan I is banned in the EU, and efforts are underway to ensure food safety and prevent further contamination.

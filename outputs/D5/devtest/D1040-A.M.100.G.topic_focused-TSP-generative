Robert Blake, accused of murdering his wife Bonny Lee Bakley, faced intense questioning during his trial.
His defense team opted not to have him testify, relying instead on a videotaped interview.
Witnesses testified to Blake's disdain for Bakley, with claims that he tried to hire others to kill her.
The defense emphasized the lack of direct evidence linking Blake to the crime.
Despite the prosecution's arguments, the defense painted a picture of Blake as a man trapped in a loveless marriage with a manipulative wife.
The jury was left to decide Blake's fate, weighing the circumstantial evidence presented.

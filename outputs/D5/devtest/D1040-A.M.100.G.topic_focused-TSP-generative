Robert Blake, accused of murdering his wife Bonny Lee Bakley, faced intense questioning during his trial.
His defense team opted not to have him testify, relying instead on a videotaped interview.
Witnesses testified to Blake's disdain for Bakley, with allegations of soliciting hitmen to kill her.
The defense emphasized the lack of direct evidence linking Blake to the crime.
Despite the prosecution's portrayal of Bakley as a con artist, the defense urged jurors to focus on the lack of concrete proof against Blake.
The trial concluded with a plea from Blake's lawyer to end the nightmare and give him his life back.

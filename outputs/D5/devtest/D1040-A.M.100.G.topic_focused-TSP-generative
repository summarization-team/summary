Robert Blake, accused of murdering his wife Bonny Lee Bakley, faced intense questioning during his trial.
His defense chose not to call him to the stand, instead presenting a videotaped TV interview.
Witnesses testified to Blake's disdain for Bakley, with allegations of soliciting others to kill her.
The defense emphasized the lack of direct evidence linking Blake to the murder.
Despite the prosecution's portrayal of Blake as a cold-hearted killer, his lawyer argued that he was a man driven by emotions.
The trial concluded with a plea to end the nightmare for Robert Blake and give him back his life.

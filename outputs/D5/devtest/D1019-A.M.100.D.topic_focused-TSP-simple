Sipadan, popular for diving, is an island off the northeast coast of Sabah, the Malaysian side of Borneo island, which is shared with Indonesia.
Chong Kah Kiat, the minister of tourism and environment for Sabah, said the island was near two Malaysian naval bases on the eastern coast of Sabah.
Osman Ibrahim, a police spokesman in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, confirmed that the two who escaped were Americans and that they were still in Sabah.

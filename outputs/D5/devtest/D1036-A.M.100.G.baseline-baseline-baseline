The White House Monday urged Ukraine to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
Asked about the diagnosis, made at an Austrian clinic, spokesman Scott McClellan replied: "It was terrible news to hear, and it's certainly disturbing."
I know the Ukraine government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," the spokesman said after doctors at the clinic confirmed for the first time that Yushchenko had swallowed relatively large amounts of dioxin.

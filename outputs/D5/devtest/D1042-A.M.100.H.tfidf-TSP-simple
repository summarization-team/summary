Defense lawyer Rick Hernandez asked the military judge, Colonel James Pohl, to recuse himself because he had presided over all the other Abu Ghraib abuse cases.
Pohl became increasingly frustrated during the questioning and told Hernandez that in order to recuse himself: "I "'d" have to believe there was an appearance of impropriety from two colonels and two three-star generals."

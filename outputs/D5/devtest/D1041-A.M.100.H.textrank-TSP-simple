More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
The IUCN plans to release a detailed report on the state of the world's coral reefs next month.
The conservation union--which produces a "red list" of the world's most endangered species--also warned the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.

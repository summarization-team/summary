As long as poverty, population growth and lack of alternative livelihoods keep people dependent on already depleted reef resources, the coral reefs of South Asia will continue to degrade," the union's South Asia marine coordinator, Jerker Tamelander, said.
More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
The IUCN plans to release a detailed report on the state of the world's coral reefs next month.

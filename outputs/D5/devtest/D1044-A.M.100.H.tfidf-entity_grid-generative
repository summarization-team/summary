The dye, used in non-edible items, was found in chilli powder used by Premier Foods, affecting over 400 products like Pot Noodle and ready-made meals.
The Food Standards Agency urged the public to return affected items for a refund due to potential cancer risks.
The EU is also investigating the issue, with other countries like China taking precautions.
Companies failing to ensure food safety could face legal consequences.

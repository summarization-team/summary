Zhang Lijun, deputy director of China's State Environmental Protection Administration, emphasized holding the chemical plant accountable for the pollution in the Songhua River.
The explosion in Jilin caused benzene to contaminate the river, prompting water supply shutdowns in Harbin.
Both provinces activated environmental contingency plans to safeguard water safety.
China informed Russia of the pollution situation and pledged cooperation.
Measures like diluting pollutants and enhancing monitoring were implemented.
Efforts to minimize the impact on Russia are ongoing, with experts estimating around 100 tons of benzene pollutants in the river.

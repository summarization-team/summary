Zhang Lijun, deputy director of China's State Environmental Protection Administration, emphasized holding the chemical plant accountable for the pollution in the Songhua River.
The explosion in Jilin caused benzene to contaminate the water, prompting Harbin to shut down water supplies.
Both Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces activated environmental contingency plans.
China informed Russia of the pollution situation and pledged to minimize the impact on their neighbor.
Measures like diluting pollutants and enhancing monitoring are in place.
The polluted water is expected to reach the Sino-Russian border in about 14 days.
China is committed to reducing emissions and ensuring water quality control.

Australia strongly opposes Japanese plans to expand whaling in Antarctic waters due to concerns of piracy under the Antarctic Treaty.
Attorney General Philip Ruddock stated that boarding Japanese ships could lead to accusations of piracy.
Despite this, Australia continues to campaign for a South Pacific whale sanctuary.
Prime Minister John Howard criticized Japan's decision to increase whale harvest but opts for diplomatic measures over interception.
The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986, but countries like Japan continue under the guise of scientific research.
Whaling opponents fear a potential pro-whaling majority at the commission.

Californians voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to become the first US state to fund controversial embryonic stem cell research that was effectively banned by President George W. Bush, US media reported.
The emotionally- and politically-charged Proposition 71, which allows nearly three billion dollars to be put aside for stem cell research over 10 years, passed by 64 percent against 36 percent opposition, CNN reported, citing early poll results.
Supporters of the measure say the decision could help find cures to diseases including cancer, AIDS, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease more quickly than had been expected.

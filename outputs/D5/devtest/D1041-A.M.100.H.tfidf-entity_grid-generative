The World Conservation Union issued a warning at a congress in Bangkok, highlighting the threats to coral reefs in South Asia due to human activities, climate change, and introduced species.
The devastation caused by tsunamis in the region has further exacerbated the situation, impacting marine ecosystems and endangering over one billion people.
Efforts to protect coral reefs include creating artificial reefs from discarded materials and monitoring for threats like pollution and overfishing.
Urgent action is needed to prevent further decline and preserve these vital ecosystems for future generations.

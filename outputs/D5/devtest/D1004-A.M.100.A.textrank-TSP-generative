A devastating tsunami hit Papua New Guinea's north coast, leaving at least 70 confirmed dead and many missing.
The death toll could potentially reach 2,000, with entire villages wiped out.
The affected area, home to 8,000 to 10,000 people, is in urgent need of relief supplies.
Australia has pledged assistance, including a mobile hospital and transport for aid.
The situation is described as "horrific," with estimates of over 1,000 casualties and thousands injured or homeless.
Efforts are underway to provide medical assistance and support to the affected communities.

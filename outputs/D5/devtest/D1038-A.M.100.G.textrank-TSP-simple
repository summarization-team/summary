US Geological Survey scientists said the eruption at 11:57am (1857 GMT) marked a "small explosion" following a week of intensifying earthquakes in the area.
This was small explosive eruption from the lava dome that lasted for 24 minutes and generated a plume that rose up to a height of just under 10,000 feet (3,000 meters)," said USGS volcano and hydrology expert John Major.

The devastating tsunami in Papua New Guinea's north coast has left at least 300 people dead or missing, with villages crushed and thousands in need of aid.
The 23-foot wall of water hit without warning, wiping out communities and leaving many elderly victims.
Australian aid is being mobilized, with relief supplies and a mobile hospital being sent to the remote region.
The death toll is expected to rise, with reports of entire villages being destroyed and hundreds still unaccounted for.
The international community is shocked by the scale of the disaster and stands ready to assist in any way possible.

The devastating tsunami that hit Papua New Guinea's north coast resulted in at least 300 people dead or missing.
The wave, triggered by an earthquake, struck the area without warning, killing 70 and destroying villages.
The affected population, estimated at 8,000 to 10,000, faced a dire situation with limited food and shelter.
Australia swiftly responded, offering transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital.
The death toll continued to rise, with reports of entire villages being wiped out and hundreds still unaccounted for.
The international community expressed shock and pledged support to help the affected region recover.

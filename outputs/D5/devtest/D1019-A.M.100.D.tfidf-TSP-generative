In 1969, Indonesia and Malaysia disputed islands due to a failed agreement on the continental shelf.
Masked assailants abducted over 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, on Sipadan Island.
The abductors demanded the release of militants jailed in the US.
Rebels in the Philippines claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.
The hostages, including tourists and resort workers, were taken to the Philippines.
Malaysian and Philippine authorities are working together to rescue the hostages.
The motive behind the abduction remains unclear, but efforts to track down the kidnappers are ongoing.

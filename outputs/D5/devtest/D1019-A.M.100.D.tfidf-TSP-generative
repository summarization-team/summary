In 1969, Indonesia and Malaysia disputed islands over a continental shelf.
Masked assailants abducted 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, on Sipadan Island.
The area is a top diving spot with limited access to protect wildlife.
The rebels behind the kidnapping demand the release of militants jailed in the US.
Filipino rebels also hold 27 hostages in the Philippines.
Malaysian and Philippine authorities are working together to rescue the hostages.
The situation remains tense as the motives of the captors are unclear.
The hostages, including foreigners, are safe for now.

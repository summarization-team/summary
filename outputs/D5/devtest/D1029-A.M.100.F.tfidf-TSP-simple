Earlier corps spokesman Colonel Rizwan Malik said the tribesmen used light and heavy weapons and also rained more than 150 rockets and mortar shells on a nearby military base.
He described the rebels "'" claims that up to 50 tribesmen had been killed in the exchange of fire as "exaggerated" but said there had been some casualties.
The clash erupted when a convoy of soldiers came under attack by armed men belonging to the Bugti tribe in the clan's stronghold of Dera Bugti, some 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of the provincial capital Quetta, he said.

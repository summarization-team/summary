More than 160 workers were evacuated from a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea due to instability, resulting in a loss of 130,000 barrels per day.
The gas leak was contained after four hours, with Statoil working to stabilize the situation.
Production on the Snorre A platform remains suspended, impacting Norway's daily output.
Statoil is aiming to resume partial production soon, while other platforms in the North Sea face similar challenges.
The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority is closely monitoring the situation, with hopes of full production resuming by the end of the month.

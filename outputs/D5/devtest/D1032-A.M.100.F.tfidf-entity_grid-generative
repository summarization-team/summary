More than 160 workers were evacuated from a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea due to instability, resulting in a loss of 130,000 barrels per day.
The gas leak was contained after four hours, affecting production on the Snorre A platform operated by Statoil.
The suspension of operations led to a total loss of 200,000 barrels per day, impacting Norway's oil output.
Statoil is working to resume production gradually, with the hope of reaching full capacity by the end of the year.
Other oil companies in the region also faced production challenges due to gas leaks and equipment damage.

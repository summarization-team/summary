Japanese and US officials began talks Thursday on resuming US beef shipments to top export market Japan, banned last year over mad cow disease fears, amid signs of a resolution to the dispute.
Japan, the largest export market for US beef, is among about three dozen countries that halted US beef imports after mad cow disease was discovered there in December 2003.
Japan had insisted on testing all US beef imports as a condition for lifting the ban, which the US side has refused, but the difficulty in detecting the disease in younger cows led Japan to back down.

President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea "'s" ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by businesses to politicians during the presidential poll in 2002.
A Samsung executive was accused of donating illicit funds to political parties while dozens of lawmakers, politicians and aides to Roh were arrested.

China's love for cars has led to an 80% growth in the car market, making it the world's fourth largest.
However, this has resulted in dangerous roads filled with inexperienced drivers.
The WHO reports that China's road fatalities are underreported, urging the implementation of safety measures like seat belts and helmets.
In Argentina, over 7,000 people died in road accidents in 2003, prompting a crackdown on seat belt violations.
Similarly, Uganda is enforcing strict traffic regulations, with fines for not wearing seat belts or helmets.
ASEAN countries are also working towards improving road safety to prevent future accidents and fatalities.

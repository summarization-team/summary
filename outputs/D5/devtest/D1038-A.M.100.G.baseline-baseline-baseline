US volcano Mount St. Helens roared to life Friday, spewing a giant plume of steam and ash into the sky and raising fears of a new larger eruption.
After letting off steam from its lava cap in a spectacular natural display, the rumblings stopped and the huge cloud quickly dispersed.
But the burst of activity sent scientists scrambling to establish whether the volcano, which killed 57 people when it erupted dramatically 24 years ago, was holding another more powerful eruption in store.

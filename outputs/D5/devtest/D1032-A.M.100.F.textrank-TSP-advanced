more than 160 of 216 people working on a Norwegian oil platform in the north sea were evacuated .
one of the rigs became "unstable", causing a loss of output of 130,000 barrels per day .
the gas leak came from an injection well used to pump gas and water into a layer of oil .
production on two platforms shut down last week due to a gas leak cut production by 4% .

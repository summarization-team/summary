Mount St. Helens, dormant for 18 years, erupted with a minor explosion, sparking fears of a larger eruption.
Scientists detected thousands of earthquakes, hinting at more eruptions.
The recent activity caused a tremor and steam eruption, leading to evacuations.
Despite similarities to the 1980 eruption, experts believe the current one is less severe.
The eruption, though short-lived, raised concerns about potential debris flows.
Scientists observed no signs of an imminent major eruption, attributing the event to rising magma.
The situation remains monitored closely for any further developments.

Theodore Kaczynski, 54, was arrested in Montana and is held without bail.
He pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks in Sacramento, where he is jailed.
His lawyers seek a single trial for all charges.
Attorney General Janet Reno authorized seeking the death penalty.
Kaczynski faces trial in November for bombings that killed two men.
Jurors' identities will be kept secret in the Sacramento trial.
Nearly 600 prospective jurors are being interviewed.
Legal experts suggest Kaczynski may avoid the death penalty due to mental health issues.
The trial is expected to last up to six months.

A potentially cancer-causing red dye was found in chilli powder used by Premium Foods to make Worcester Sauce, leading to the recall of over 350 food products in Britain.
The Food Standards Agency urged the public to return affected items for a refund.
The illegal dye, Sudan I, poses a small risk of cancer but has been removed from most products.
Investigations are ongoing to determine how the dye entered the food chain, with other countries on alert for tainted imports.
China has banned foods containing Sudan I, emphasizing the global impact of the contamination scare.

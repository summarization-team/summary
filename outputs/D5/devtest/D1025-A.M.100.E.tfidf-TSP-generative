A recent study by the University of Calgary revealed that grizzly bears in Banff National Park have the lowest reproductive rate in North America due to human-related deaths.
Efforts to protect the bears have been successful, leading to a significant increase in their population.
However, concerns remain about potential threats such as climate change and food source depletion.
The proposal to remove Yellowstone grizzlies from the endangered species list has sparked controversy, with some groups opposing the move.
Despite the recovery of the grizzly population, challenges persist in ensuring their long-term survival.

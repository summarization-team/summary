Unabomber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski pleaded innocent via video to charges of a fatal mail bomb attack.
Prosecutors are considering seeking the death penalty for the California bombings.
Attorney General Janet Reno authorized the death penalty for Kaczynski, accused of a 17-year bombing spree.
Defense efforts to exclude key evidence were rejected, and Kaczynski was moved to a federal prison.
Jury selection began for his trial, with efforts to ensure an impartial jury.
The trial is expected to last up to six months, with heightened security measures in place.

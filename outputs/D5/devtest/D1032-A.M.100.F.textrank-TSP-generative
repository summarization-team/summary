A gas leak on the Snorre oil field in the North Sea led to the evacuation of 160 workers and a loss of 130,000 barrels per day.
Statoil is working to stabilize the situation and seal the leak to resume production.
The gas leak, deemed serious, originated from an injection well.
Production on two platforms remains suspended, reducing Norway's oil output by 205,000 barrels per day.
Statoil aims to gradually resume production, pending approval from authorities.
The shutdown also impacted Shell's operations due to damaged equipment and adverse weather conditions.
Efforts are ongoing to address the situation and prevent further leaks.

A gas leak on the Snorre oil field in the North Sea led to the evacuation of 160 workers and a loss of 130,000 barrels per day.
Statoil is working to stabilize the situation and seal the leak to resume production.
The incident caused a 4% reduction in Norway's daily oil production.
Statoil aims to restart operations by December 31, pending approval from the Petroleum Safety Authority.
The shutdown also impacted the nearby Vigdis field, resulting in a total loss of 205,000 barrels per day.
Weather conditions have delayed repairs and inspections, affecting production on multiple platforms.

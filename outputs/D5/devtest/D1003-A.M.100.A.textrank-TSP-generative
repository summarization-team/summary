China is set to complete its first blood bank for pandas, aiding in research on their blood types and transfusion compatibility.
With only 1,600 pandas in the wild, conservation efforts are crucial, especially for the Qinling pandas.
The government's habitat restoration efforts have led to panda sightings in the Qinling mountains.
However, threats like poaching and food shortages persist.
To combat this, reserves are planting more bamboo to support the pandas.
Efforts are also being made to protect the pandas' natural habitats and increase forest coverage in key regions.

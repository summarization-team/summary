The agency has published a full list of the affected items, which are stocked by Britain's main supermarket chains and include ready-made meals such as shepherd's pie, pasta bake, cottage pie, chicken wings, sausage casserole, pizza, steak and kidney pie and chilli con carne.
The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester Sauce, which was then used as an ingredient in a wide range of products, the FSA said.

The agency has published a full list of the affected items, which are stocked by Britain's main supermarket chains and include ready-made meals such as shepherd's pie, pasta bake, cottage pie, chicken wings, sausage casserole, pizza, steak and kidney pie and chilli con carne.
It is illegal to put Sudan 1 into food in Britain and the rest of the European Union and all chilli powder imported since July 2003 has to be certified free of the agent.
The offending sample is thought to have entered Britain beforehand.

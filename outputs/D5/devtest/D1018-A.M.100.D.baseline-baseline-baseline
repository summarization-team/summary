Three young men who acknowledged partying with an 18-year-old honors student from Alabama before she went missing last week told police that a man dressed in a security uniform approached her as they dropped her off at her hotel, a source close to the investigation said Thursday.
The men were arrested Thursday in connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, who they said they last saw in front of the Holiday Inn shortly before 2 a.m. on May 30.

Chong Kah Kiat, the minister of tourism and environment for Sabah, said the island was near two Malaysian naval bases on the eastern coast of Sabah.
The abductors surprised and captured the group on a beach on Sipadan Island late Sunday, and two foreign tourists managed to escape the men, Semporna police chief Sulaiman Junaidi told The Associated Press by telephone.
The hostages were said to have been taken onto a boat and are now at sea.
He said most of the hostages were Europeans and Americans.
Sulaiman said the assailants were believed to be Filipinos.

Shouting "murderers, "" " and "You deserve lynching, "" " the crowd demanded to know whether their relatives were actually on board the Helios Airways flight ZU522 that left Larnaca for Athens International Airport when it crashed at about 12:20 p.m. (0920GMT) near Grammatiko, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Greek capital.
Angry relatives swarmed the counters at Larnaca airport, hurling curses at the managers of an airline whose plane crashed in Greece earlier Sunday, killing all passengers and crew on board.
Greek state television quoted Cyprus Transport Minister Haris Thrasou as saying the plane had problems with decompression in the past.

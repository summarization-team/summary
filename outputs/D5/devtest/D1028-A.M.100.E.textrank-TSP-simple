Kaczynski, 54, was arrested April 3 at his cabin in Lincoln, Montana, and is being held without bail.
Prosecutors have said they hope to decide before January whether to seek the death penalty, which Kaczynski could also face for the two California bombing deaths.
Kaczynski, the former Berkeley mathematics professor, has pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks that killed two people in Sacramento.
Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.

Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
Kaczynski, the former Berkeley mathematics professor, has pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks that killed two people in Sacramento.
Prosecutors have said they hope to decide before January whether to seek the death penalty, which Kaczynski could also face for the two California bombing deaths.
Kaczynski's plea from California was made through a live hookup to the federal courthouse in Newark, New jersey, where Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise presided in a courtroom, The Associated Press reported.

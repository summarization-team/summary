Supporters of the California stem cell research measure believe it will accelerate finding cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.
The proposition, passed by a significant margin, aims to make California a global hub for stem cell research.
The decision allows for circumventing federal restrictions on human embryonic stem cell research.
Meanwhile, research on Parkinson's disease has revealed insights into dopamine's impact on learning.
Additionally, exercise shows promise in slowing the progression of Parkinson's by protecting brain cells.
Scientists have also identified a gene linked to Parkinson's in certain families, offering new avenues for research and potential prevention strategies.

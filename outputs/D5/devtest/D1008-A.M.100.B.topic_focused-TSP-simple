While watermen have been able to harvest oysters elsewhere, they agreed not to harvest in the managed reserves for several years until the majority of the oysters grew to four inches, one inch bigger than the state "'s" legal size.
Once the Chesapeake Bay "'s" premiere species, native oysters have been virtually wiped out due to over-harvesting and disease.

The final day of Robert Blake's defense case featured his daughter, Delinah Blake-Hurwitz, testifying about adopting Rosie, a child who was withdrawn and kept folding into a fetal position.
Witnesses spoke of Blake's anxiety over Bakley's pregnancy and his desire to keep Rosie away from her.
Blake described himself as an "old man" picking up women in bars before his relationship with Bakley.
The defense rested without calling Blake to the stand, but a TV interview was played in court.
Prosecutors argued that Blake killed Bakley, but the defense emphasized the lack of evidence linking him to the crime.

The trial for Russell Henderson, accused in the beating death of Matthew Shepard, was postponed to April 6 due to a scheduling conflict.
Shepard, a gay student, died after a brutal attack in Laramie motivated by hate.
Henderson and Aaron McKinney face murder charges and the death penalty.
Jury selection begins March 24 in a case that has sparked calls for stronger hate-crime laws.
Shepard's mother advocated for such laws, emphasizing the need to deter violence against specific groups.
The trial has drawn attention to bias crimes and the importance of equal treatment under the law.

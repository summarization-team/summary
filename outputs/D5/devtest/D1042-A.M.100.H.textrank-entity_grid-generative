Private Lynndie England, a key figure in the Abu Ghraib scandal, pleaded guilty to multiple charges at her court-martial.
Defense lawyers sought a new judge due to prior involvement in related cases.
England admitted to mistreating detainees under the influence of her ex-boyfriend, Charles Graner.
She acknowledged the wrongdoing and expressed regret for following orders blindly.
The plea deal reduced her potential sentence from 16.5 to 11 years in prison.
England's case marked the closure of a high-profile chapter in the scandal, with others facing consequences for their roles in the disturbing events at the Baghdad prison.

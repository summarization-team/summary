Two Americans escaped the Malaysian hostage situation in Sabah, where most captives were Europeans and Americans.
The kidnappers, believed to be Filipinos, took the hostages onto a boat at sea.
The Murphys, who hid in bushes until dawn, avoided being forced into the water.
Malaysian and Philippine authorities are working to locate the hostages, mostly foreign tourists.
The armed pirates' motives remain unclear, but efforts are underway to secure the hostages' release.
The situation is isolated, and authorities assure the safety of visitors to Sipadan Island, a renowned scuba-diving destination.

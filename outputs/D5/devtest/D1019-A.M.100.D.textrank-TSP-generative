Two Americans escaped a kidnapping in Sabah, Malaysia, where most hostages were Europeans and Americans.
The assailants, believed to be Filipinos, took the hostages onto a boat at sea.
The Murphys, who hid in bushes until dawn, arrived in Kuala Lumpur but refused media interviews until all hostages were safe.
Malaysian and Philippine authorities are investigating the abduction, with vigilantes retaliating against the Abu Sayyaf group.
The hostages, including foreign tourists, were taken to Sulu in the Philippines.
Efforts are underway to secure their release, with authorities tracking the pirates in Malaysian and Philippine waters.

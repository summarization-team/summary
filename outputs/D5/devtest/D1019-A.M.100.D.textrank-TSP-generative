The hostages, including Americans, were taken to sea, with most believed to be Europeans and Americans.
The Murphys, an American couple, escaped by hiding in bushes overnight.
The Philippine military is investigating the involvement of the extremist group Abu Sayyaf.
Malaysian and Philippine authorities are coordinating efforts to locate the hostages.

The assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked outrage and demands for Syrian troop withdrawal from Lebanon.
Opposition leaders blamed Lebanese and Syrian authorities for the crime and called for international intervention.
French President Jacques Chirac demanded an international investigation, while Saudi Arabia rejected the idea, citing Lebanon's independence.
Hariri, a Sunni Muslim and successful businessman, was mourned by hundreds of thousands at his funeral.
The assassination highlighted tensions between Lebanon and Syria, with calls for unity against those seeking to sow discord.
The perpetrators claimed the attack was in retaliation for Hariri's ties to Saudi Arabia.

The assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked demands for Syrian troop withdrawal from Lebanon.
Opposition leaders blamed Lebanese and Syrian authorities for the crime and called for international intervention.
French President Jacques Chirac pushed for an international investigation, while Saudi Arabia rejected the idea, asserting Lebanon's independence.
Hariri, a Sunni Muslim and influential figure in Lebanon's reconstruction, was mourned by hundreds of thousands.
The assassination may lead to a shift in Lebanon-Syria relations, with an emboldened opposition calling for change.
Hariri's burial at an unfinished mosque he funded drew foreign dignitaries and massive crowds.

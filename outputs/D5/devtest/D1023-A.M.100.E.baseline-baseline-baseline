Independent Counsel Hearings Open
WASHINGTON (AP)--Congress should just let the independent counsel law expire since almost any effort to revise it so soon after President Clinton's impeachment acquittal "is likely to be a mistake," former White House chief of staff Howard Baker told a Senate committee today.
He spoke to the Governmental Affairs Committee at its opening hearing on whether to renew, rewrite or let the law die.
The 1978 statute is due to expire June 30.

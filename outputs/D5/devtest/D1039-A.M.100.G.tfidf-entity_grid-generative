Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, known for his controversial views on Islam, was tragically shot and stabbed to death in broad daylight while cycling in Amsterdam.
His film "Submission" sparked outrage in the Muslim community for its portrayal of women in Islamic culture.
The suspect, a 26-year-old with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality, had ties to extremist Muslims.
The Dutch government condemned the murder and emphasized the importance of freedom of speech.
The assassination drew comparisons to the killing of politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002, highlighting societal divisions and the need for unity in the face of extremism.

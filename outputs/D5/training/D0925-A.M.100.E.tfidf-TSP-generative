IBM's loss of Apple as a customer is not a major blow to their sales or profits, as per The New York Times.
However, it is a significant win for Intel, who is adjusting after losing their partnership with Microsoft.
Apple's switch to Intel chips is seen as a move to compete with Microsoft and Sony in the home entertainment market.
This transition could lead to lower prices for Apple products.
Despite concerns, analysts believe Apple's reputation for software and design will remain strong.
The move to Intel processors is part of a broader industry shift towards consumer electronics, posing challenges for Apple's future competitiveness.

The European probe Huygens successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter and is on its way to Titan, the only moon with an atmosphere in our solar system.
It will remain dormant until reaching Titan's upper atmosphere, where it will start transmitting data back to Earth.
Scientists eagerly await the first in-situ data from Titan, hoping to uncover its mysteries.
Equipped with instruments to analyze Titan's atmosphere and surface, Huygens aims to shed light on the moon's potential for hosting life.
The probe's successful landing on Titan could provide valuable insights into the origins of life on Earth.

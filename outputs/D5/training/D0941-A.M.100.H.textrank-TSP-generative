The European probe Huygens successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter and is on its way to Titan, the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere.
Scheduled to reach Titan in 20 days, Huygens will wake up shortly before entering the moon's upper atmosphere to start sending data back to Earth.
Equipped with instruments to study Titan's atmosphere and surface, the probe will deploy a parachute for a controlled descent.
Scientists eagerly await the first data from Titan, hoping to uncover clues about the moon's mysterious chemistry and potential for life.

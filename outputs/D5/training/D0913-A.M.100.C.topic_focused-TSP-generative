The US Supreme Court reviewed the legality of displaying the Ten Commandments in public spaces, sparking a debate on the separation of church and state.
Arguments centered on the historical significance versus religious connotations of the commandments.
Opponents argued that such displays endorse Christianity, while supporters emphasized their secular and legal importance.
The court grappled with the fine line between acknowledging religious heritage and violating constitutional principles.
Despite differing opinions, the justices will issue a written ruling by late June.
The case highlights the ongoing cultural battle over Christianity's role in public life and government property.

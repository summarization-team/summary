The US Supreme Court reviewed the legality of displaying the Ten Commandments in public spaces, sparking a debate on the separation of church and state.
Cases from Kentucky and Texas challenged the use of government property for religious displays.
Arguments focused on the historical significance of the Commandments and their context in law.
Opponents argued that such displays endorse Christianity, while supporters emphasized their secular and historical value.
The court grappled with the fine line between religion and law, with a decision expected by June.
Thomas Van Orden, the plaintiff in the Texas case, remained focused on the legal issues, regardless of personal circumstances.

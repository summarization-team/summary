Both prosecution cases hinge partly on women who were allegedly close to Malik and Bagri.
The men, Sikhs who immigrated to Canada from India's northern state of Punjab, are each charged with eight counts of murder and conspiracy in what was the world's worst airborne terrorist act before September 11, 2001.
The verdict is unlikely to be the final chapter in the bombings case, however, because police continue to investigate other suspects.
Two potential witnesses in the case, both Sikh journalists, were assassinated.

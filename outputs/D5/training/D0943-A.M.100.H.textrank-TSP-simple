Two potential witnesses in the case, both Sikh journalists, were assassinated.
The verdict is unlikely to be the final chapter in the bombings case, however, because police continue to investigate other suspects.
The men, Sikhs who immigrated to Canada from India's northern state of Punjab, are each charged with eight counts of murder and conspiracy in what was the world's worst airborne terrorist act before September 11, 2001.
A third man, Inderjit Singh Reyat, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for a conviction in the Narita explosion, and was also charged with Bagri and Malik.

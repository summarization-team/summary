The European probe will remain dormant until the on-board timer wakes it up shortly before it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere, after which the probe will begin sending data back to Earth.
It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan, the only moon in the solar system which has an atmosphere.
The European-made space probe Huygens has successfully separated from the US spacecraft Cassini and headed toward Titan, a NASA official said on Saturday.
The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter," Rosemary Sullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory told AFP.

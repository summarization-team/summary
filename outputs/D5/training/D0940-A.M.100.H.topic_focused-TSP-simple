Other feng shui influences include the park "'s" orientation to face water with mountains behind, Hong Kong Disneyland spokeswoman Esther Wong said.
Disney officials consulted Chinese feng shui experts before building Hong Kong Disneyland, making changes such as tilting the site of the park several degrees and setting up "no fire zones "" " in kitchens, a company spokeswoman said Sunday.
Hong Kong Disneyland _ built on reclaimed land in the outlying Lantau island _ is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the Hong Kong government, but local taxpayers are footing most of the construction bill.

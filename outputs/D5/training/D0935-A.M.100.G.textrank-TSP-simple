The agreement calls for the District of Columbia government to enact funding for a new ballpark by December 31.
Major League Baseball owners Friday conditionally approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington for the upcoming season.
This is another important step in finalizing the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington DC," baseball commissioner Bud Selig said.
Until a new ballpark is built, Washington will play at RFK Stadium.
The last time a major league club moved cities was after the 1971 season, when the Washington Senators became the Texas Rangers.

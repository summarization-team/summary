Until a new ballpark is built, Washington will play at RFK Stadium.
The agreement calls for the District of Columbia government to enact funding for a new ballpark by December 31.
Major League Baseball owners Friday conditionally approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington for the upcoming season.
This is another important step in finalizing the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington DC," baseball commissioner Bud Selig said.
The approval was "subject to all conditions set forth in the Baseball Stadium Agreement," signed by the Expos and Washington Mayor Anthony Williams.

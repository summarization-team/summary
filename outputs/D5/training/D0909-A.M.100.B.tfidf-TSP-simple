Northern Ireland has seen a virtual end to more than 30 years of violence since the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace deal, but Dublin and London, as well as an independent monitoring body, have accused paramilitary groups of continued criminal activities.
The IRA's alleged misdeeds were highlighted by a massive bank raid in Belfast in December, blamed by police on the group, as well as the murder of Robert McCartney, a Belfast man beaten and stabbed to death in a bar in what his relatives say was an attack carried out by IRA activists.

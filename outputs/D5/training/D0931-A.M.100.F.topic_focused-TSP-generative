Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani scientist behind the atomic bomb, supplied highly enriched uranium to Iran in 2001.
This led to concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Khan's network also facilitated the transfer of nuclear technology to Libya, accelerating their weapons program.
Pakistani scientists were rumored to be aiding US commandos in locating Iranian nuclear sites, but this was denied by the foreign ministry.
Despite allegations of nuclear proliferation, Pakistan defended its efforts to prevent leaks.
The International Atomic Energy Agency continued to investigate Iran's nuclear activities, suspecting a covert weapons agenda.
Pakistan's handling of Khan's activities raised questions about military involvement.

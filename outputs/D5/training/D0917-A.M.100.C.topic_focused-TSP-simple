Historic conclave to elect a new pope for a church in disarray
The new pope has already been chosen by the Lord.
At some point soon after the new pope is chosen, the Vatican also will ring bells.
Although the conclave could last for days, a pope could be chosen as early as Monday afternoon if the red-capped prelates opt to begin casting ballots after their solemn procession from the Vatican "'s" Apostolic Palace to the chapel.

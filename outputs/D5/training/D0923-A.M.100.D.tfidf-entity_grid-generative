Tennessee Republican Alexander, along with Democrats and state officials, opposed White House-backed driver's license rules in an $82 billion spending bill.
The rules, written by Rep. Sensenbrenner, aim to enhance license security but face backlash for cost and privacy concerns.
Immigrant advocates criticize the bill as anti-immigrant, worsening post-9/11 hostility.
The Real ID Act, part of the bill, tightens license issuance requirements to prevent terrorism.
Critics fear delays, costs, and privacy violations, while proponents argue for national security benefits.
The bill's passage is imminent, sparking debates on immigration reform and national ID card implications.

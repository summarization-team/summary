A February 2 launch was cancelled because the jet stream moved too far north, which meant Fossett would lose too much fuel catching up to it to make it the rest of the way around the world.
The February 6 and February 8 launches were cancelled because the jet stream moved too close to Kansas and created a situation of heavy wind and turbulence.
But it needs to avoid the jet stream until it reaches its cruising altitude or else it could be damaged by heavy turbulence.

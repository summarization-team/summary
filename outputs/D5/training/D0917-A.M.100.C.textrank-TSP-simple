On Sunday, the cardinals moved into the super-secure Domus Sanctae Marthae, a euro26 million (US $20 million) hotel that John Paul had constructed inside Vatican City so they could rest in comfort in private rooms between voting sessions.
Representing 52 countries, the 115 crimson-robed "princes" of a church stung by priest sex-abuse scandals and an exodus of the faithful were to celebrate a midmorning Mass at St. Peter's Basilica before sequestering themselves in the Sistine Chapel at 4:30 p.m. (1430 GMT).

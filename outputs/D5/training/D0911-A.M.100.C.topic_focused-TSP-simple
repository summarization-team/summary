Fischer has been held since July when he attempted to fly out of Japan on an allegedly invalid US passport, but from detention he has been unable to renounce his US citizenship.
Chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces prison if he returns to the United States, can only avoid deportation from Japan if Iceland upgrades its granting of residency to full citizenship, a Japanese lawmaker said Wednesday.
Mizuho Fukushima, head of the opposition Social Democratic Party, told a press conference that Japanese immigration officials are opting to deport Fischer to the United States unless Iceland grants him nationality.

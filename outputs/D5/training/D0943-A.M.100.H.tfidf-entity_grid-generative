Final arguments began in the trial of two Sikh immigrants from India accused of the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people.
Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik face charges of murder and conspiracy.
Prosecutors claim they sought revenge for the Indian government's actions against Sikhs.
The motive was to establish an independent Sikh state called Khalistan.
The trial, one of Canada's most extensive, revealed details of the plot, including the planting of bombs on Air India flights.
The case, marred by police mishaps and witness deaths, remains unresolved after nearly two decades.

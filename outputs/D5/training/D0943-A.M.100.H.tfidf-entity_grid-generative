Final arguments were set to begin in the case of two Sikh immigrants accused of the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people.
The men, from Punjab, Canada, face charges of murder and conspiracy in the world's deadliest pre-9/11 terrorist act.
Prosecutors claim they sought revenge for the Indian government's actions against Sikhs.
The motive was to establish an independent Sikh state and avenge the 1984 attack on the Golden Temple.
The trial, spanning two decades, has shed light on the tragic event, with justice finally in sight for the victims' families.

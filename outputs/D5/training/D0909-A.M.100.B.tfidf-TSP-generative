Since the 1998 Good Friday peace deal, Northern Ireland has experienced a significant reduction in violence.
However, concerns persist over paramilitary groups engaging in criminal activities.
Recent events, such as a bank raid in Belfast and the murder of Robert McCartney, allegedly by the IRA, have raised alarm.
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern are working towards progress, but obstacles remain, including demands for photographic verification of IRA weapon decommissioning.
Dialogue between political leaders and calls for IRA disarmament are ongoing, with hopes for a peaceful resolution before the August holiday period.

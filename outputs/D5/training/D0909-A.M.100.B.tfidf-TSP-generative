Northern Ireland has experienced a significant reduction in violence since the 1998 Good Friday peace deal, but paramilitary groups are still engaging in criminal activities.
Recent events, such as a bank raid and a murder linked to the IRA, have raised concerns.
Political leaders from Dublin and London are meeting to address these issues and push for progress in the peace process.
The IRA's potential disarmament is a key factor in moving towards lasting peace, with calls for an end to all paramilitary and criminal activities.
The hope is for a positive response from the IRA before the August holiday period.

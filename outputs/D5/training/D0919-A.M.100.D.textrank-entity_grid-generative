In a 1995 TV interview, Diana expressed discomfort with the crowded nature of her marriage to Prince Charles due to his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.
Despite Charles' admission of infidelity after their marriage had broken down, Diana blamed Parker Bowles for the union's failure.
The upcoming civil ceremony at Windsor Castle will be a private affair for family and friends.
The Archbishop of Canterbury supports the marriage, hoping it brings comfort.
While some Britons welcome the news, others doubt Parker Bowles will ever match Diana's popularity.
Ultimately, she will become HRH Duchess of Cornwall, not Princess of Wales.

In a 1995 TV interview, Diana expressed discomfort with the crowded nature of her marriage to Prince Charles due to his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.
Despite Charles' admission of infidelity, the couple remained friends until Diana's tragic death in 1997.
Charles and Camilla will have a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, with support from Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Camilla will become the HRH Duchess of Cornwall, but not the Princess of Wales.
The news of their upcoming marriage has garnered mixed reactions, with some comparing Camilla to the beloved Princess Diana.

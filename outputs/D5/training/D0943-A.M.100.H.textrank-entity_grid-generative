Sikh immigrants from India, Malik and Bagri, face charges in the Air India bombings that killed 331 people in 1985.
Prosecutors built a case on witness testimonies, phone records, and surveillance.
The trial revealed motives of revenge for the 1984 Golden Temple attack and a desire for an independent Sikh state.
Witnesses confessed details of the plot, while defense teams questioned their credibility.
The trial, lasting 202 days, involved 113 witnesses and concluded with final arguments.
Despite challenges in police work and witness killings, the verdict remains uncertain.
The case sheds light on a tragic chapter in Canadian history.

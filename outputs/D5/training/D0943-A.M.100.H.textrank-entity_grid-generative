Sikh immigrants from India, Malik and Bagri, face charges for the Air India bombings in 1985, resulting in 331 deaths.
Prosecutors built a case on witness testimonies, phone records, and surveillance.
Motivated by revenge for the Golden Temple attack, the accused sought to create Khalistan.
Witnesses confessed details of their involvement, while Bagri's lawyer claims innocence.
The trial, spanning 202 days with 113 witnesses, has been marred by bungled police work and witness assassinations.
The verdict remains uncertain, with no direct evidence linking the accused to the bombings.

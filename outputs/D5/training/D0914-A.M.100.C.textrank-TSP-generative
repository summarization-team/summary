A car bomb attack at the Hilton hotel in Taba, Egypt, killed 23 Israelis and injured over 100 people of various nationalities.
The explosions, likely caused by car bombs, targeted tourist camps in the Sinai desert, with at least 35 dead and 125 injured.
Israeli officials suspected Hamas involvement, coinciding with Jewish holidays.
Despite warnings, many Israelis continued to visit Sinai, prompting evacuation efforts post-attacks.
The Egyptian government initially attributed the blasts to gas leaks, but Israeli rescue efforts were hindered.
Amid escalating tensions, calls for immediate evacuation of Israelis from Sinai were issued, emphasizing the volatile security situation.

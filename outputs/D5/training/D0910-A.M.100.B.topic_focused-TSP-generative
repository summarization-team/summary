Sri Lanka's top Tamil Tiger rebel group initiated a week-long meeting in Switzerland to prepare for peace talks with the government.
The Swiss foreign ministry praised the LTTE's commitment to negotiations and supported a federal structure for an interim administration in the north-east.
Meanwhile, internal conflicts within the rebels led to violent incidents, including the killing of a renegade rebel by police commandos.
The government finalized counter proposals to the rebels' ISGA plan, with hopes of restarting direct negotiations.
Efforts to revive peace talks have been ongoing, with Japanese envoy Yasushi Akashi pushing for a resolution.

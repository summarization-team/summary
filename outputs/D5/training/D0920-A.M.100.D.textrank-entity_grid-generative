Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, collaborates with Ronan Keating on a new version of "Father and Son."
Despite a recent flight diversion due to security concerns, Islam remains dedicated to his music career.
Additionally, he advocates for peace and condemns terrorism, earning him a prestigious peace prize.
Amidst security measures like Secure Flight, concerns arise over the inclusion of innocent individuals on watchlists.

The church is officially neutral on the issue, but former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey recently urged the couple to marry.
Clarence House did "n't" immediately announce further details, but Sky News TV reported that the heir to the throne would marry on April 6.
Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England if he took the throne, and some Anglicans remain opposed to remarriage of divorcees.
They remained friends but Diana blamed Charles "'" relationship with Parker Bowles, who was also married, for the failure of their union.

Passengers were tossed around the inside of their trains and some had to jump from the upper decks of the wreckage, eyewitnesses told reporters.
One of the stricken trains then side-swiped a stationary freight train that was parked on a side-track in the area, knocking it over, officials said.
This whole incident was started by a deranged individual who was suicidal," he said announcing that the depressed driver, identified as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, was unhurt and was in custody.

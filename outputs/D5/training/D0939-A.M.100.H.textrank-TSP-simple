The driver allegedly manoeuvred his Jeep onto the tracks, where it became stuck, and waited for a train to end his life, according to Adams and other police officials.
One of the stricken trains then side-swiped a stationary freight train that was parked on a side-track in the area, knocking it over, officials said.
A murder investigation was launched as the death toll rose following the horrific early morning crash involving three trains and a sports utility vehicle in the heavily-populated Los Angeles suburb of Glendale.

Despite GPS malfunctions and a slow start, Fossett remains optimistic.
Branson, Virgin's founder, closely monitors the mission's progress.
The flight, expected to last 60-80 hours, aims to break records and promote aviation innovation.
Fossett's endurance and piloting skills will be tested during the journey.
With high hopes for fuel-efficient planes, the GlobalFlyer project could revolutionize commercial aviation.

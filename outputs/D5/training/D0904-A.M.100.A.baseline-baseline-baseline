Rioting erupted Saturday in an impoverished neighborhood of Toledo, Ohio after hundreds of counter-protestors broke up a planned march by a neo-Nazi group, Toledo police confirmed.
Scores of rioters rampaged through streets wrecking cars and setting a building on fire in north Toledo after police fired tear gas on the anti-Nazi group.
Six people were arrested, according to Fox News.
The violence broke out after a group of nearly 80 white supremacists of the Virigina-based National Socialist Movement assembled for a march against what they called black gang violence against whites in the Toledo neighborhood.

Pakistan's military spokesman denied ceasefire violations in Kashmir, where India and Pakistan have a history of conflict.
Despite ongoing tensions, a bus service between the two zones of Kashmir is set to resume after six decades, allowing families to reunite.
The peace process has led to the exchange of passenger lists for the bus service, symbolizing progress in resolving the longstanding dispute.
However, Kashmiri separatist leaders emphasize the need for their inclusion in peace talks.
Both countries are exploring compromises, raising hopes for a peaceful resolution in the region.

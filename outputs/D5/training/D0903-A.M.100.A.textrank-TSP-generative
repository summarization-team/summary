Portugal, one of Europe's most oil-dependent nations, will construct the world's largest solar energy power station near Moura.
The plant, managed by Amper Central Solar, will feature 350,000 solar panels spread over 114 hectares, producing 62 megawatts.
The project, led by BP Solar, aims to create 240 jobs in Alentejo, a region ripe for solar energy.
Meanwhile, a Dutch team won a solar-powered car race in Australia, showcasing the potential of solar technology.
The Philippines and Spain are also investing in solar projects, highlighting the global shift towards renewable energy sources.

The European space probe Huygens successfully detached from the US spacecraft Cassini and is en route to Titan, the only moon with an atmosphere in our solar system.
Huygens will awaken shortly before entering Titan's upper atmosphere to start transmitting data back to Earth.
The probe's descent will provide crucial information about Titan's chemistry and surface features.
Scientists eagerly await the first-hand data from this mysterious moon, hoping to uncover clues about the origins of life on Earth.
Huygens' mission marks a historic milestone in space exploration, shedding light on Titan's enigmatic environment.

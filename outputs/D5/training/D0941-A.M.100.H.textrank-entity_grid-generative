The European-made Huygens space probe successfully detached from the US spacecraft Cassini and is en route to Titan, the only moon with an atmosphere in our solar system.
It will remain inactive until reaching Titan's upper atmosphere, where it will start transmitting data back to Earth.
Cassini will adjust its course to avoid following Huygens into Titan's atmosphere.
Huygens is equipped to analyze Titan's atmosphere and surface, potentially shedding light on the moon's mysterious features.
Scientists eagerly await the probe's findings, hoping to uncover clues about Titan's composition and potential for life.

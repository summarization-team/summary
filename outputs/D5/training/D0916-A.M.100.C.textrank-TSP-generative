American journalist Jill Carroll, working for the Christian Science Monitor, was kidnapped in Baghdad by gunmen who killed her Iraqi interpreter.
The Monitor pleaded for her release, emphasizing her dedication to revealing the truth about the Iraq war.
Carroll's family issued an emotional appeal, describing her as a friend to Iraqis.
The Islamic Army of Iraq claimed responsibility for the abduction and threatened Carroll with execution unless female prisoners were freed.
The US government denied negotiating with insurgents in Iraq.
Carroll's fate remains uncertain as efforts continue to secure her release.

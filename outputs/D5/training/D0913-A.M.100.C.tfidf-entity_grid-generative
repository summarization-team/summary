The US Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of displaying the Ten Commandments in public spaces, sparking a debate on the separation of church and state.
Justices are divided on whether these displays endorse religion or hold historical significance.
Cases from Texas and Kentucky are under scrutiny, with arguments focusing on the context of the displays.
Opponents argue that the monuments violate the First Amendment, while supporters claim they are cultural symbols.
The outcome of these cases could redefine the boundaries between religion and government in American society, with implications for future displays on government property.

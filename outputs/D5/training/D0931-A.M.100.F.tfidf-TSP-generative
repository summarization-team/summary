Abdul Qadeer Khan, known as the father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, supplied highly enriched uranium to Iran in 2001, fueling concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions.
The Khan network's global black market in nuclear technology has had far-reaching consequences, leading to arrests in South Africa and illicit transfers to Libya.
Despite skepticism and denials from Pakistani officials, reports suggest collaboration with the US in targeting Iranian nuclear sites.
The unfolding scandal raises questions about the extent of Khan's activities and the involvement of the Pakistani military.
The international community remains vigilant in investigating and preventing further nuclear proliferation.

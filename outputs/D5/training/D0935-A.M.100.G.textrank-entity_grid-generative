Major League Baseball owners approved the Montreal Expos' move to Washington, a significant step according to commissioner Bud Selig.
The agreement requires the District of Columbia to fund a new ballpark by December 31.
Until then, the team will play at RFK Stadium.
Despite initial funding challenges, the city and MLB reached an agreement.
The Nationals, formerly the Expos, will debut in Washington against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
The stadium construction will be partially privately financed, with the city selling bonds for the project.
The Nationals' future looks promising in their new home.

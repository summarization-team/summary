Prince Charles announced his engagement to Camilla Parker Bowles, with a civil ceremony planned at Windsor Castle.
Despite some opposition from Anglicans due to their divorces, Archbishop Rowan Williams welcomed the news.
The couple's sons, William and Harry, expressed their happiness.
Camilla will not be Queen but will hold the title of HRH Duchess of Cornwall.
Their relationship, unlike Charles' previous marriage, is characterized by mutual affection and support.
The wedding will be a private affair, with well-wishes from Prime Minister Blair and the public.
Queen Camilla may not be as popular as Princess Diana, but the couple's genuine bond is evident.

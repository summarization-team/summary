Cardinals from 52 countries gathered at St. Peter's Basilica for a Mass before entering the Sistine Chapel for the papal conclave.
The choice for the new pope boiled down to an older administrator or a dynamic pastor from Latin America.
Issues like priest sex-abuse scandals and a shortage of priests were key.
The cardinals took an oath of secrecy and began voting, with Cardinal Ratzinger a front-runner.
Opus Dei's influence and the challenges facing the Church were hot topics.
Black smoke signaled no decision yet, with Ratzinger urging adherence to church doctrine.
The next pope's attitude towards modern challenges was emphasized.

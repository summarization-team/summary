Two commuter trains collided in a tragic accident near Los Angeles, resulting in ten deaths and over 100 injuries.
The collision occurred after one train derailed upon hitting a car left on the tracks by a suicidal man.
Passengers had to be rescued from the wreckage, with some jumping to safety from burning railway carriages.
The man responsible, Juan Manuel Alvarez, initially intended to take his own life but changed his mind at the last moment.
The incident has led to charges of murder against Alvarez, who caused the worst train wreck in the United States since 1999.

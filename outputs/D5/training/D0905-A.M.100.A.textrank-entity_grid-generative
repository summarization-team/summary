Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) plans to invest over NT $10 billion in wind power generation over the next decade.
The company will install 200 wind power generators with a total capacity of 300,000 kilowatts in coastal regions.
However, an amendment to the 2005 defense bill could halt offshore wind projects in the US, including one in Massachusetts.
Despite concerns about the environmental impact of large-scale wind farms, the Cape Wind project aims to advance offshore wind power generation.
The debate over wind energy continues, with regulatory, economic, and aesthetic considerations at the forefront.

US Supreme Court examines issue of displaying Ten Commandments
The US Supreme Court on Wednesday was to review the displaying in public spaces of the Ten Commandments, the fundamental moral precepts of Judeo-Christian religions, in a case that could define the extent of separation of church and state in American society.
The court will review, in the Kentucky case, the legality of displaying framed copies of the Ten Commandments in two courthouses among copies of other documents that form the basis of US laws.

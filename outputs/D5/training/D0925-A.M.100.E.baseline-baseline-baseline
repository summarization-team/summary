Apple Computer is expected to announce Monday that it will begin using Intel chips in its Macintosh machines next year, ending a 14-year alliance with IBM and its processors, according to US media reports.
The move is a major change in strategy for Apple, according to The Wall Street Journal's online edition.
The New York Times called it "an unprecedented gamble."
This is a seismic shift in the world of personal computing and consumer electronics," Richard Doherty, president of a computer and consumer electronics industry consulting firm, told the Times.

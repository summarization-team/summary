Israeli intelligence services have repeatedly warned holidaymakers to avoid the Sinai desert, particularly Taba.
Following a blast at the Hilton hotel in Taba, another explosion occurred in Nuaiba, leaving over 100 people dead or injured.
The explosions, suspected to be caused by car bombs, targeted tourists celebrating the end of Sukkot.
Despite warnings, thousands of Israelis continue to visit Sinai for its attractions.
Israeli officials have urged Egypt to enhance security measures and prevent arms smuggling into Gaza.
In response to the attacks, Israel is facilitating the evacuation of its citizens from the region.

Apple Computer is set to switch to Intel chips in its Macintosh machines, ending a long partnership with IBM.
This move aims to align Mac prices with competitors and attract more developers.
CEO Steve Jobs believes Intel's technology will enhance Macs for the next decade.
The transition will begin in 2006 and be completed by 2007.
While Intel gains bragging rights, IBM refocuses on other markets.
Apple's shift to Intel may lower computer prices and increase competition.
Developers face challenges adapting software, but Apple aims to ease the transition.
Overall, the move signifies a significant change in the tech industry landscape.

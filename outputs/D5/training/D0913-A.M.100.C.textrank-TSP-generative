The US Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of displaying the Ten Commandments in public spaces, sparking debates on the separation of church and state.
Conservative justices support the displays as symbols of government authority from God, while liberal justices question the constitutionality of explicitly religious exhibits.
Lawyers argue over the historical and secular significance of the commandments, with concerns raised about government endorsement of religion.
The court faces challenges in establishing a clear standard for evaluating such displays, highlighting the complex intersection of law, religion, and constitutional principles in American society.

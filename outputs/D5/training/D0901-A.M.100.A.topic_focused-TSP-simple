Indian, Pakistan military to discuss alleged Kashmir ceasefire
Indian and Pakistani military commanders were to discuss Wednesday Indian charges that Pakistan fired mortar shells across the border into Indian-controlled Kashmir in violation of a 14-month ceasefire.
India and Pakistan began the ceasefire November 25, 2003, after routinely exchanging artillery fire across the volatile Line of Control, the de facto border separating their armies in Kashmir, as part of a tentative peace process.
No one from Pakistan has fired and there is no ceasefire violation by Pakistan, "" " Pakistan military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told AFP in Islamabad.

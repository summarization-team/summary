No one from Pakistan has fired and there is no ceasefire violation by Pakistan, "" " Pakistan military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told AFP in Islamabad.
On Wednesday, Islamabad denied it had violated the ceasefire in the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, spark of two of three wars between Indian and Pakistan, and over which they skirmished in 2002.
India and Pakistan began the ceasefire November 25, 2003, after routinely exchanging artillery fire across the volatile Line of Control, the de facto border separating their armies in Kashmir, as part of a tentative peace process.

The European-made space probe Huygens has successfully separated from the US spacecraft Cassini and headed toward Titan, a NASA official said on Saturday.
The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter," Rosemary Sullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory told AFP.
They received the signal, I think at 7:24 (0324 GMT) this evening."
It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan, the only moon in the solar system which has an atmosphere.
It is scheduled to arrive at its destination on January 14.

Final arguments to begin in Air India bombing trial by Deborah Jones
Prosecutors say Sikh extremists in Canada built two suitcase bombs, bought airline tickets and checked the suitcase bombs onto Vancouver flights connecting with Air India.
Two potential witnesses in the case, both Sikh journalists, were assassinated.
Both prosecution cases hinge partly on women who were allegedly close to Malik and Bagri.
The first woman to testify once worked for Malik and says the pair were in love.
Josephson is hearing the complicated trial alone without a jury.

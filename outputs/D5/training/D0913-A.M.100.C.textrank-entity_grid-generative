The US Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of displaying the Ten Commandments in public spaces, sparking debates on the separation of church and state.
Justices are grappling with whether these displays violate the First Amendment's prohibition on establishing an official state religion.
Supporters argue the commandments are a secular symbol of law, while challengers claim they promote Judeo-Christian beliefs.
The court's decision could clarify decades of conflicting rulings on government endorsement of religion.
Amid protests and legal arguments, the case highlights the complex intersection of religious freedom and constitutional principles.

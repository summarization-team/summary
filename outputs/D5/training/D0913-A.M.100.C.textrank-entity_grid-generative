The US Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of displaying the Ten Commandments in public spaces, sparking debates on the separation of church and state.
Conservative and liberal justices clashed over the religious displays, with Scalia defending them as a symbol of government authority from God.
Challenges in Texas and Kentucky question the constitutionality of such exhibits, with arguments focusing on whether they violate the First Amendment.
Supporters argue the Commandments have historical and secular significance, while opponents claim they promote a specific religious viewpoint.
The court's decision could clarify the blurry line between government endorsement of religion and secularism.

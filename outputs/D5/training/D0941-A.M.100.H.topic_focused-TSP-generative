The European space probe Huygens successfully separated from the US craft Cassini, embarking on a 20-day journey to Titan, the only moon with an atmosphere in our solar system.
Once it reaches Titan, Huygens will awaken and start transmitting data back to Earth.
Equipped with instruments to study Titan's atmosphere, Huygens may provide insights into the moon's composition and potential for life.
This mission, a joint effort by NASA, ESA, and the Italian space agency, aims to unlock the mysteries of Titan and deepen our understanding of planetary evolution.

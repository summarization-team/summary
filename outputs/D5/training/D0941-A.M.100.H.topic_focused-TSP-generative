The European space probe Huygens successfully separated from the US craft Cassini and is now on its way to Titan, the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere.
It will take 20 days for Huygens to reach Titan, where it will wake up shortly before entering the upper atmosphere to start sending data back to Earth.
Equipped with instruments to sample Titan's atmosphere, Huygens may reveal whether there are liquid methane or ethane lakes on the moon's surface.
Scientists hope this mission will provide insights into the conditions that existed on early Earth before life began.

Environmentalists say the answer to global warming is to slash emissions themselves and swiftly wean the world off dirty fossils and onto renewable sources and hydrogen.
It would not be the miracle cure to global warming or switch off the dependence on fossil fuels that are the source of the problem, they admit.
Taking out the CO2 from fuel is called "carbon neutral, "" " in other words not adding further to emissions from that source.
Driving their case is the fear that time is running out for dealing cheaply with the carbon pollution spewed out by fossil fuels.

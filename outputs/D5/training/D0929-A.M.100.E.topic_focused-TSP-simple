Oil prices drop amid OPEC output pledge, Hurricane Rita
World oil prices fell further on Tuesday, despite a new hurricane powering towards oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, and as OPEC pledged to supply more crude from the start of October if required.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meanwhile, pledged to make an extra two million more barrels per day available to oil markets from October 1 if there were adequate demand, while holding its official production ceiling at 28 million barrels per day.

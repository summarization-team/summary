Chess legend Bobby Fischer, known for his maverick behavior and criticism of the US, faces 10 years in prison for violating sanctions by playing in Yugoslavia in 1992.
Supporters fear an unfair trial due to his controversial statements, including praising 9/11.
Japan may deport him to the US, but Iceland granting him citizenship could prevent this.
Fischer's link to Iceland dates back to his 1972 victory against Boris Spassky.
Despite opposition, Icelandic politicians are likely to grant him citizenship, resolving his legal limbo and allowing his release from Japanese custody.

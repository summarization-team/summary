Chess legend Bobby Fischer, known for his maverick behavior and criticism of the US, faces 10 years in prison for violating sanctions by playing in Yugoslavia in 1992.
Supporters fear an unfair trial due to his controversial statements, including praising 9/11.
To avoid deportation from Japan, Fischer needs full citizenship from Iceland.
Despite opposition, Japan has not discussed his case with the US or Iceland.
Fischer's link to Iceland dates back to his 1972 victory against Boris Spassky.
Icelandic politicians are likely to grant him citizenship, resolving his legal limbo and allowing his release soon.

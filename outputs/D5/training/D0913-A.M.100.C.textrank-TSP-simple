The Texas case involves the legality of a stone monument inscribed with the commandments installed on the grounds of the state legislature.
Last October, the Supreme Court declined to review a third case, concerning the installation of a stone replica of the commandments in front of the state Supreme Court of Alabama.
The US Supreme Court on Wednesday was to review the displaying in public spaces of the Ten Commandments, the fundamental moral precepts of Judeo-Christian religions, in a case that could define the extent of separation of church and state in American society.

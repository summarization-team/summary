The marriage is a sensitive issue because Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive.
The church is officially neutral on the issue, but former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey recently urged the couple to marry.
They remained friends but Diana blamed Charles "'" relationship with Parker Bowles, who was also married, for the failure of their union.
In 1994, Prince Charles admitted in a TV documentary that he had strayed from his marriage vows, but insisted the infidelity happened only after the marriage was "irretrievably broken down, us both having tried."

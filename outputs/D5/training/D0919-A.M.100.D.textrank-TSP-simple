The marriage is a sensitive issue because Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive.
Charles was previously married to Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.
They remained friends but Diana blamed Charles "'" relationship with Parker Bowles, who was also married, for the failure of their union.
There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded," Diana said in a 1995 TV interview.

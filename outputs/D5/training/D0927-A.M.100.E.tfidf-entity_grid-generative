Peter Jennings, the iconic face of ABC News, has been diagnosed with lung cancer, prompting him to begin outpatient chemotherapy immediately.
Despite his illness, Jennings plans to continue anchoring "World News Tonight" when possible.
His departure would mark the end of an era for network news, following the exits of Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather.
Viewers and colleagues alike express support for Jennings as he faces this health challenge.
ABC News prepares for his absence by lining up substitute anchors, including Charles Gibson and Elizabeth Vargas, while Jennings focuses on his treatment and recovery.

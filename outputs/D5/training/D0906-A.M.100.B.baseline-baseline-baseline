Usually sunny southern California has been whipped the past few days by storms that have killed at least two and caused floods, mudslides, power blackouts and deadly traffic accidents.
A man died and another was injured in Los Angeles "'" Elysian Park when a hillside collapsed and buried the two in the tent in which they were sleeping on Saturday night, officials said.
The victims "were sleeping in a tent at the top of the hill when the hill gave way," Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said.

115 cardinals from 52 countries gathered in the sistine chapel on monday .
they voted inconclusively but failed to reach agreement on a successor to pope john paul ii .
the conclave is a secret and sacred gathering to elect a new pontiff .
"we likewise pledge and swear to observe with the greatest fidelity," a cardinal says .

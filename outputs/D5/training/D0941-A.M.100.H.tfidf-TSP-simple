The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter," Rosemary Sullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory told AFP.
The European-made space probe Huygens has successfully separated from the US spacecraft Cassini and headed toward Titan, a NASA official said on Saturday.
At launch time, specially designed springs gently pushed Huygens away from Cassini onto a ballistic four-million-kilometer (about 2.5-million-mile) path toward Titan.
The European probe will remain dormant until the on-board timer wakes it up shortly before it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere, after which the probe will begin sending data back to Earth.

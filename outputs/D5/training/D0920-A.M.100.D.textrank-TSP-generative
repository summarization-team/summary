Cat Stevens, now known as Yusuf Islam, is making a comeback with a duet with Ronan Keating.
The 56-year-old singer, who sold 50 million records in the past, recorded a new version of his hit "Father and Son."
Yusuf Islam's recent trip to Nashville was cut short due to a security incident involving a passenger on the no-fly list.
This incident highlights the need for improved security measures like the Secure Flight system.
Despite challenges, Yusuf Islam remains dedicated to promoting peace and condemning terrorism, as recognized by the upcoming "Man for Peace" award ceremony in Rome.

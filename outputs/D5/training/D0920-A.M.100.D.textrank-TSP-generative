Cat Stevens, now Yusuf Islam, is making a comeback with a duet featuring Ronan Keating.
Islam, known for hits in the 60s and 70s, was recently detained in the US due to a passenger on the no-fly list.
This incident highlights the need for improved security measures.
Meanwhile, Islam is set to receive a peace prize for his dedication to promoting peace and condemning terrorism.
Despite challenges with watchlists, efforts are being made to enhance air travel security.
In the midst of it all, music continues to be a source of emotion and connection.

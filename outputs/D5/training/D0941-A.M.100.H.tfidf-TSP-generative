The European-made space probe Huygens successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter and is now on its way to Titan, the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere.
It will remain dormant until it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere, where it will start sending data back to Earth.
The mission aims to gather in-situ data from Titan, potentially confirming the presence of rain, lakes, and rivers on the moon.
Scientists are eager to explore Titan's atmosphere, which resembles early Earth, and hope to gain insights into the origins of life.
The Huygens probe's descent and observations will provide valuable information for future space exploration endeavors.

The European-made space probe Huygens successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter and is now on its way to Titan, the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere.
It will remain dormant until it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere, where it will start sending data back to Earth.
The mission aims to gather in-situ data from Titan, potentially confirming the presence of rain, lakes, and rivers on the moon.
Scientists are eager to explore Titan's surface and atmosphere, hoping to uncover clues about the early Earth and the emergence of life.

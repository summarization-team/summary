Preparations are complete for Steve Fossett's solo, non-stop flight around the globe aboard the GlobalFlyer.
The main challenge is avoiding the jet stream until reaching cruising altitude to prevent turbulence damage.
Fossett, equipped with a parachute, is ready for the three-day journey testing his endurance and piloting skills.
Despite GPS malfunctions and antenna issues, the flight is proceeding as planned.
Virgin Atlantic's funding of the project aims to advance aviation technology for more fuel-efficient planes.
Fossett's historic flight, supported by Sir Richard Branson, marks a significant milestone in aviation history.

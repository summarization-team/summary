Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) reveals a 10-year plan to invest over NT $10 billion in wind power generation.
The initiative aims to support Taiwan's eco-friendly policies by installing 200 wind power generators with a total capacity of 300,000 kilowatts in coastal regions.
However, a proposed amendment in the US could halt offshore wind projects, including a $800 million venture in Massachusetts.
Despite concerns about the impact of large wind farms on local weather, advocates emphasize the benefits of clean energy.
The push for offshore wind power reflects a global shift towards renewable energy sources.

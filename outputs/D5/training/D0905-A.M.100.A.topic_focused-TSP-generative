Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) announced a 10-year plan to invest over NT $10 billion in wind power generation.
The initiative aims to support the government's eco-friendly policy.
Initially, 200 wind power generators with a total capacity of 300,000 kilowatts will be installed in coastal regions.
However, an amendment in the 2005 defense bill could hinder offshore wind power projects in the U.S.
Despite concerns about the impact of large wind farms on local weather, advocates emphasize the benefits of clean energy.
The push for offshore wind energy is gaining momentum globally, with Spain also venturing into offshore wind farm development

Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman on the US Supreme Court, announced her retirement, giving President George W. Bush the chance to shape the court's balance.
This sets off a confirmation battle in the Senate, focusing on issues like abortion.
O'Connor, a moderate conservative, was appointed by Reagan in 1981.
Bush praised her service and promised a dignified selection process for her successor.
With her retirement, the court faces its first vacancy in 11 years, sparking intense political maneuvering over her replacement.
Activists on both sides are gearing up for a contentious battle over the future direction of the court.

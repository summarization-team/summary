Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman on the US Supreme Court, announced her retirement, giving President George W. Bush the chance to shape the court's ideology.
This sets the stage for a confirmation battle in the Senate, focusing on issues like abortion and church-state separation.
O'Connor, a moderate conservative, was appointed by Reagan in 1981.
Bush praised her service and promised a dignified confirmation process for her successor.
With her retirement, the nation braces for a fierce political showdown over her seat, with activists on both sides gearing up for a partisan battle.

Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman on the US Supreme Court, announced her retirement, giving President George W. Bush the chance to shape the court's ideology.
This sets off a confirmation battle in the Senate, focusing on issues like abortion and church-state separation.
O'Connor, a moderate conservative appointed by Reagan, will step down upon confirmation of her successor.
Bush vows to select a justice Americans can be proud of, while Democrats fear a shift towards a pro-life stance.
The vacancy after 11 years opens the door to a historic battle over the court's future.

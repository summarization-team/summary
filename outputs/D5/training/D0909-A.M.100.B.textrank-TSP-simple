I am confident, now, with an imminent IRA statement expected, which I hope will be credible, that it will open a new chapter in Northern Irish politics," Hain told BBC Radio Ulster.
Britain expects an "imminent" statement from the IRA as to whether the Northern Irish paramilitary group is to agree to an appeal from its political wing to abandon violence, a government minister said Monday.
In April, Adams called on the IRA to "fully embrace and accept" democratic means and end all paramilitary activities.

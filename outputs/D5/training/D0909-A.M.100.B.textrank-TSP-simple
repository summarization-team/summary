London and Dublin are awaiting for an Irish Republican Army response to a call from Gerry Adams, leader of the group's Sinn Fein political wing, for an end to violence.
Britain expects an "imminent" statement from the IRA as to whether the Northern Irish paramilitary group is to agree to an appeal from its political wing to abandon violence, a government minister said Monday.
I am confident, now, with an imminent IRA statement expected, which I hope will be credible, that it will open a new chapter in Northern Irish politics," Hain told BBC Radio Ulster.

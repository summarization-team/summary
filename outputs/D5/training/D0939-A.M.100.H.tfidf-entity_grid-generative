Ten people died and over 100 were injured in a tragic train collision caused by a suicidal man leaving his car on the tracks in Glendale, near Los Angeles.
The rush-hour train derailed, leading to a catastrophic crash with another commuter train.
The impact resulted in a citywide tactical alert being declared, with officers aiding in rescue efforts.
The man responsible, Juan Manuel Alvarez, faces multiple murder charges.
The incident, the worst train wreck since 1999, has prompted calls for increased rail safety measures and a thorough investigation into the events leading up to the tragedy.

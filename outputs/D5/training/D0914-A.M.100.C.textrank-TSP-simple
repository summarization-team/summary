From the first information that we have received it could have been a car bomb attack," a senior Israeli foreign ministry official told AFP, requesting anonymity.
Israeli radio reported that the blast was likely an attack, with an Israeli foreign ministry saying it could have been a car bomb attack, although the Egyptian public TV had earlier said the blast was due to a gas leak.
At least 23 Israelis were killed in the blast, Egyptian police said.

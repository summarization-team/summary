The European Medicines Agency is to review all drugs in the same class as Vioxx after US pharmaceutical giant Merck withdrew the arthritis drug, a spokesman for the agency said Friday.
Merck announced a global withdrawal Thursday of Vioxx, a blockbuster arthritis drug, after a study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks.
We are going to see whether there is a class effect," a spokesman for the London-based agency said.
The US Food and Drug Administration also has said it would study the effects of other drugs in the same class as the withdrawn drug.

The UN, US, EU, Japan, UK, and China expressed deep concern over King Gyanendra's actions in Nepal.
Gyanendra dissolved the government, imposed a state of emergency, and claimed absolute power to restore peace and democracy amidst a Maoist insurgency.
The move was widely condemned by Nepal's allies, including the US, UK, and India.
Human rights abuses by both sides in the conflict were criticized, with fears that without aid, the Maoists could gain power.
Nepal's path to stability remains uncertain, with calls for the restoration of democracy and peace talks with the rebels.

Prince Charles is to marry his partner Camilla Parker Bowles, the prince's office said Thursday.
Clarence House did "n't" immediately announce further details, but Sky News TV reported that the heir to the throne would marry on April 6.
Charles was previously married to Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.
She was divorced from Charles when she died.
Charles dated Camilla many years before he married Diana in 1981.
They remained friends but Diana blamed Charles "'" relationship with Parker Bowles, who was also married, for the failure of their union.

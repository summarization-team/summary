This represents a big shareholder win and a major step forward in the case," Jay Eisenhofer, the plaintiffs lawyer, said in a statement.
A federal judge has allowed Tyco International Ltd. shareholders to go forward with a class action lawsuit against the company and others.
In the class-action lawsuit, shareholders seek damages against the company, Kozlowski; Swartz; Mark Belnick, former director Frank Walsh; and the company's auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Barbadoro dismissed the claim seeking damages on behalf of Tyco against most of its current directors and several of its former directors and officers.

A federal judge has allowed Tyco International Ltd. shareholders to go forward with a class action lawsuit against the company and others.
Barbadoro dismissed the claim seeking damages on behalf of Tyco against most of its current directors and several of its former directors and officers.
But U.S. District Judge Paul Barbadoro on Thursday struck down a related claim that sought damages on behalf of Tyco stemming from allegations of fraud and corporate looting.

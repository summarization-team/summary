Bobby Fischer, the chess legend known for his maverick behavior and criticism of the US, faces 10 years in prison for violating sanctions by playing in Yugoslavia in 1992.
Japan may deport him to the US, but Iceland granting him citizenship could prevent this.
Fischer's supporters argue he wouldn't get a fair trial in the US due to his controversial statements.
Iceland's parliament recently granted him citizenship, showing widespread support.
Fischer's release is imminent, with plans for an Icelandic delegation to bring him back to Reykjavik, ending a legal battle that began in 1992.

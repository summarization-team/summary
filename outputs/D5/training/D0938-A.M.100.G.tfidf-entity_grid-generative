The Reflecting Absence memorial at the World Trade Center will honor the 2,749 victims of the 9/11 attacks.
Former US presidents and prominent figures are leading the project to raise $500 million for the memorial and cultural facilities.
The memorial will feature two reflecting pools symbolizing the void left by the twin towers.
Architect Michael Arad aims to make the absent presence of the tragedy felt.
The memorial will include remnants of the original towers and a granite fragment from the 1993 bombing.
It is set to be completed by 2009, providing a place for reflection and remembrance.

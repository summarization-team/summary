The Reflecting Absence memorial at the World Trade Center will honor the 2,749 victims of the 9/11 attacks.
Former US presidents and prominent figures are leading the project to raise $500 million for the memorial and cultural facilities.
The memorial will feature two reflecting pools symbolizing the void left by the twin towers.
The memorial will include the names of all victims, including those from the 1993 bombing.
The memorial is set to be completed by 2009, providing a place for reflection and remembrance for generations to come.

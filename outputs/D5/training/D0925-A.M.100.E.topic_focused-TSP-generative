Apple Computer is set to announce a major shift from IBM to Intel chips for its Macintosh machines, ending a 14-year partnership.
This move aims to provide customers with top-notch personal computers and align Mac prices with competitors.
By embracing Intel, Apple anticipates a consistent chip supply, broader developer community, and enhanced competitiveness.
The transition, starting in 2006 and completing by 2007, signifies a strategic leap towards mainstream PC market integration.
Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO, emphasized Intel's superior processor roadmap as the driving force behind this transformative decision, marking a significant milestone in Apple's technological evolution.

Apple Computer is set to switch from IBM to Intel chips in its Macintosh machines, aiming to enhance performance and lower costs.
This move, announced by CEO Steve Jobs at a developer conference, marks a significant shift for the tech giant.
Jobs emphasized Intel's superior processor roadmap and the benefits of a consistent chip supply.
The transition is expected to be completed by 2007, with the potential to attract a larger developer community and align Mac prices with competitors.
This decision reflects Apple's commitment to innovation and delivering top-quality personal computers to customers.

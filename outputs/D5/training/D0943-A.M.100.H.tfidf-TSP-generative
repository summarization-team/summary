Final arguments were set to begin in the case of two Sikh immigrants accused of the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people.
The defendants, Malik and Bagri, allegedly sought revenge for the Indian government's actions against Sikhs.
Prosecutors claim they planted bombs on Air India jets in retaliation.
The motive was to establish an independent Sikh state called Khalistan.
The trial, spanning nearly two decades, revealed details of the deadly attack.
Witnesses testified to the defendants' involvement, shedding light on the tragic event that marked a dark chapter in aviation history.

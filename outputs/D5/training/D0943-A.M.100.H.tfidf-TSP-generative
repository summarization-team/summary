Final arguments began in the trial of two Sikh immigrants accused of the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people.
Prosecutors claim the men sought revenge for the Indian government's actions against Sikhs.
The accused allegedly planted bombs on Air India jets departing Vancouver.
The motive was to establish an independent Sikh state called Khalistan.
The trial, spanning nearly two decades, has been complex and costly.
Witnesses have testified to the defendants' involvement in the plot.
The case remains unresolved due to police errors and mysterious deaths.
The defendants maintain their innocence in the deadliest terrorist act before 9/11.

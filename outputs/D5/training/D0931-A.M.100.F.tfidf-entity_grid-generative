Abdul Qadeer Khan, known as the father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, supplied highly enriched uranium to Iran in 2001, with reports suggesting Iran's pursuit of a nuclear bomb.
Investigations revealed a scheme to deliver a uranium enrichment plant to Libya, potentially producing multiple nuclear bombs annually.
The reach of Khan's network led to arrests in South Africa, involving individuals from the apartheid regime's nuclear program.
Despite skepticism and denials from Pakistan and Iran, concerns persist over nuclear proliferation and Khan's activities.
Efforts to uncover the extent of Khan's network continue amid international scrutiny and diplomatic challenges.

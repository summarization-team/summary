Abdul Qadeer Khan, known as the father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, supplied highly enriched uranium to Iran in 2001, sparking concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Investigations revealed a South African scheme to deliver a uranium enrichment plant to Libya, potentially enabling the production of nuclear bombs.
The reach of Khan's network led to arrests in South Africa, raising questions about Pakistan's involvement.
Despite denials from Pakistan and Iran, suspicions persist about nuclear proliferation.
The CIA and IAEA continue to investigate, highlighting the complex web of global nuclear threats and the challenges of preventing illicit transfers.

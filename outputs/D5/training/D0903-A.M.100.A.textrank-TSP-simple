Southern Portugal's thinly populated Alentejo region has been identified as one of Europe's most promising regions for solar energy.
It will be built by BP Solar, a unit of energy giant BP, and it is expected to create 240 permanent jobs in the southern province of Alentejo, one of Europe's poorest regions.
This is a unique project and the world's most ambitious in terms of final capacity," said BP Solar commercial director for southern Europe, Francisco Conesa, according to Lusa.

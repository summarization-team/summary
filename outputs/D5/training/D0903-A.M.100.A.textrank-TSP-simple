The plant will have 350,000 solar panels spread over 114 hectares (280 acres) near the southern town of Moura and will be able to produce 62 megawatts, more than six times the largest existing solar power station in Germany.
The town of Moura owns the majority of the firm which will oversee the solar power station project, Amper Central Solar.
Portugal, one of the most oil-dependent nations in Europe, will begin work on the world's biggest solar energy power station next year, officials said Tuesday.

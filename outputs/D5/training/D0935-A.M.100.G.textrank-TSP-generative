The District of Columbia government must fund a new ballpark by December 31 for the Montreal Expos' relocation to Washington.
Major League Baseball owners conditionally approved the move, with Commissioner Bud Selig calling it a crucial step.
Until the new stadium is ready, games will be held at RFK Stadium.
The Washington Nationals, formerly the Montreal Expos, will debut in their new city against Arizona on April 14.
Despite initial funding challenges, a compromise was reached to ensure 50% private financing for the stadium.
The team's future in DC looks promising, with support from officials and fans alike.

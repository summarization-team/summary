The relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington DC was approved by Major League Baseball owners, with a new ballpark to be funded by the District of Columbia government.
Until completion, games will be held at RFK Stadium.
The move faced challenges, including private financing requirements and opposition from Baltimore Orioles owner Mr. Angelos.
Despite negotiations and concerns, the Washington Nationals are set to debut in their new city, with a temporary home at RFK Stadium.
The city's commitment to building a new ballpark and the team's future in Washington are now secured, marking a significant milestone in baseball history.

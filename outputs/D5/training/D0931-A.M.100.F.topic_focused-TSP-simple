URGENT Pakistani scientist gave Iran highly enriched uranium in 2001:
Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, delivered weapons grade highly enriched uranium to Iran in 2001, and Iran aims at getting a nuclear bomb next year, an Iranian opposition group said in Vienna Wednesday.
Once assembled in Libya, the plant could have produced enough weapons-grade uranium to manufacture several nuclear bombs a year, according to the report.
They found the elements of a two-story steel processing system for the enrichment plant, packed in 11 freight containers for shipment to Libya.

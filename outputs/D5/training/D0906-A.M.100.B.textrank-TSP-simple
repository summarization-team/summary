About 12,000 Los Angeles residents were without power, officials said.
Hundreds of cars were stranded in the snow in San Bernardino National Forest, east of Los Angeles.
The victims "were sleeping in a tent at the top of the hill when the hill gave way," Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said.
A man died and another was injured in Los Angeles "'" Elysian Park when a hillside collapsed and buried the two in the tent in which they were sleeping on Saturday night, officials said.

The trial of two Sikh immigrants from India, Malik and Bagri, charged with the Air India bombings in 1985, has been complex.
Prosecutors built their case on witness testimonies, phone records, and motives.
Bagri's lawyer claims his innocence, citing circumstantial evidence.
Witnesses allege confessions and financial aid to the convicted.
The prosecution argues Malik arranged the bombs on the planes.
The defense disputes the origin of the luggage containing the bomb.
The trial, involving 113 witnesses, seeks justice for the 331 victims.
Motivated by revenge and political aspirations, the accused aimed to establish Khalistan.

Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot prominent lawyer Harry Whittington while hunting in Texas.
Whittington is in stable condition at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi.
The incident occurred on Katherine Armstrong's ranch, where Cheney missed a quail and hit Whittington instead.
The delay in reporting the incident sparked controversy, with White House Press Secretary McClellan advocating for full disclosure.
Whittington, a millionaire attorney, suffered pellet wounds to his face, neck, shoulder, and chest.
The incident raised questions about transparency and Cheney's hunting practices, with late-night hosts poised to comment on the mishap.

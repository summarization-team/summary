US journalist Jill Carroll, working for the Christian Science Monitor, was kidnapped in Iraq.
She was seized in Baghdad by gunmen who killed her Iraqi interpreter.
Carroll, the 31st media worker kidnapped in Iraq since 2003, was not identified initially.
The Monitor pleaded for her release, as efforts were made to find her.
A video surfaced with her captors threatening to kill her unless female prisoners were freed.
Carroll's family issued an emotional appeal for her release, describing her as a kind person who loves Iraq.
The US government denied negotiating with insurgents in Iraq.

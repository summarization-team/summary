Former US presidents to joint Sept. 11 memorial board
All four living former US presidents have agreed to become honorary directors of the project for a permanent memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center.
Bush and Bill Clinton had all pledged their support for the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and would serve as honorary members of the board of directors.
Carter, Bush and Clinton were all together just last week, when they attended the dedication of Clinton "'s" presidential library.
Ford, 91, had been unable to attend the event.

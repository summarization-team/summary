OPEC pledged to increase oil supply by two million barrels per day from October 1 if needed, keeping the production ceiling at 28 million barrels per day.
Despite Hurricane Rita approaching the Gulf of Mexico, oil prices fell, with Brent crude dropping to $64.32 per barrel and NY's main contract to $66.30 per barrel.
Rita strengthened to a category two hurricane with winds of 160 km/h, prompting evacuations in Florida Keys and Texas.
Louisiana and Texas are preparing for Rita's impact, moving Katrina survivors to safety and declaring states of emergency.

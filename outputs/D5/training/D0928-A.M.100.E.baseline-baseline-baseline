A federal judge has allowed Tyco International Ltd. shareholders to go forward with a class action lawsuit against the company and others.
But U.S. District Judge Paul Barbadoro on Thursday struck down a related claim that sought damages on behalf of Tyco stemming from allegations of fraud and corporate looting.
Former top executives L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz are awaiting retrial in federal court in New York on charges of stealing $600 million (euro483.33 million) from the company.
Their first trial resulted in a hung jury.
They have denied the charges.

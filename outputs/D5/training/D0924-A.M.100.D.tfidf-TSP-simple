Vioxx, which is scientifically known as rofecoxib, has been marketed in more than 80 countries and produced sales of 2.5 billion dollars in 2003.
The European Medicines Agency carried out a review of the drug class which includes Vioxx--known as COX-2 inhibitors--at the request of French authorities, but concluded in November 2003 that the products did not need to be withdrawn from the market.
The European Medicines Agency is to review all drugs in the same class as Vioxx after US pharmaceutical giant Merck withdrew the arthritis drug, a spokesman for the agency said Friday.

Disney officials consulted Chinese feng shui experts before building Hong Kong Disneyland, adjusting the park's layout and even dropping plans to serve shark fin soup due to environmental concerns.
The park, a joint venture with the Hong Kong government, aims to attract tourists and boost the economy.
However, concerns have been raised about low-spending visitors from China creating more problems than benefits.
Despite some criticism and long queues during a charity event, the park is set to open in phases, with rehearsals underway and tickets selling well.
Special guests, including cast members and their families, will enjoy a preview before the grand opening on September 12.

Several states are concerned about the costly and invasive new driver's license rules proposed by Rep. James Sensenbrenner.
The rules aim to enhance security but have faced strong opposition from immigrant rights groups and state officials.
Critics argue that the rules reflect a hostile attitude towards immigrants and could have harmful effects on communities.
The legislation includes stringent requirements for verifying identification documents and could lead to chaos at motor vehicle offices.
Proponents claim the rules are necessary to prevent terrorism, but opponents fear they could create a national ID card system.
Congress is expected to pass the Real ID Act, sparking debate over immigration reform and privacy concerns.

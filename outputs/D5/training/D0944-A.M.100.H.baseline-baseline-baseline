The US Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments on the legality of the death penalty for criminals aged under 18 in a case that has received international attention.
The outcome appeared in the balance with the nine member court divided and the result likely to be decided by the two moderate justices.
The Supreme Court has been asked to rule on the fate of Christopher Simmons, who was condemned to death for the 1993 murder in Missouri of a woman who was abducted, tied up and thrown to her death from a bridge.
He was 17 at the time.

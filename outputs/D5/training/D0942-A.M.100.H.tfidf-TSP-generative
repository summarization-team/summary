China reiterated its "one country, two systems" approach to Taiwan while unveiling its anti-secession law.
The law, if passed, would provide a legal basis for Beijing to use force against Taiwan.
Taiwan strongly opposes this move, calling it a provocation and a unilateral attempt to alter the status quo.
President Chen Shui-bian urged the nation to confront Beijing's proposed law, which he sees as a pretext for military invasion.
The US and EU also criticize China's plan, fearing it will escalate tensions in the region.
Taiwan plans to hold a referendum to decide its future if Beijing enacts the controversial law.

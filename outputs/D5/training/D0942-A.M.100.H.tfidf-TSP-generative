China reiterated its "one country, two systems" approach to Taiwan while unveiling an anti-secession law.
The law, if passed, could authorize Beijing to use force against Taiwan.
Taiwan strongly opposes this move, viewing it as a threat to stability.
President Chen Shui-bian condemned Beijing's efforts to justify a military invasion.
The US and EU also oppose the law, fearing heightened tensions.
Taiwan may hold a referendum to decide its future if Beijing enacts the law.
The Legislative Yuan plans to pass a resolution against the anti-secession legislation.
Overall, the situation remains tense as both sides stand firm in their positions.

Fischer, 62, known for his maverick behavior and outspoken criticism of his country, may face 10 years in prison if convicted of violating US sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992.
The supporters say Fischer would not receive a fair trial in the United States due to his controversial past statements, such as hailing the September 11, 2001 attacks as "wonderful news" and anti-Jewish remarks.

Apple announced a major shift in its technology strategy by ending a 14-year partnership with IBM and switching to Intel chips for its Macintosh machines.
This move was seen as a response to competition from Microsoft and Sony in the home entertainment and gaming sectors.
CEO Steve Jobs emphasized Intel's superior technology roadmap and the benefits of a consistent chip supply.
The transition is expected to lower prices, attract more developers, and potentially increase market share.
Despite challenges, Apple aims to maintain its reputation for innovation and quality in the PC market.

The European space probe Huygens successfully detached from the US spacecraft Cassini and is en route to Titan, the only moon with an atmosphere in our solar system.
It will awaken shortly before entering Titan's upper atmosphere to start transmitting data back to Earth.
The mission, a joint effort by NASA, ESA, and the Italian space agency, aims to study Saturn, its rings, and moons.
Huygens will plunge through Titan's atmosphere, potentially confirming hypotheses about its composition and even revealing lakes or rivers of unknown substances.
The probe's successful release marks a significant milestone in space exploration.

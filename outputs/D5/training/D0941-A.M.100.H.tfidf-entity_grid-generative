The European space probe Huygens successfully detached from the US spacecraft Cassini and is en route to Titan.
It will awaken shortly before entering Titan's upper atmosphere to start transmitting data back to Earth.
The mission aims to explore Titan's atmosphere and surface, potentially confirming theories about its composition.
Huygens, equipped with instruments to analyze Titan's chemistry, may provide insights into the moon's unique environment.
The probe's successful release marks a significant milestone in the collaborative NASA-ESA mission, offering hope for groundbreaking discoveries about Titan's mysterious terrain and atmospheric conditions.

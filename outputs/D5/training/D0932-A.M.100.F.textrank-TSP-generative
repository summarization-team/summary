Kenya's deputy environment minister, Maathai, spearheaded a successful campaign to reduce plastic bag usage by 90% in just a year.
The government allocated funds from a plastic bag tax for environmental enforcement and waste prevention.
The United Nations Environment Programme urged Kenya to ban plastic bags entirely due to health and environmental risks.
Similar initiatives are being considered globally, with San Francisco proposing a 17-cent fee per bag.
Rwanda and Uganda have already taken steps to ban plastic bags, emphasizing the need for sustainable alternatives to combat plastic pollution.
Tanzania is also set to establish a recycling plant to address the growing plastic waste issue.

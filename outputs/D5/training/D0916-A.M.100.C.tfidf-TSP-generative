American journalist Jill Carroll was abducted in Baghdad by kidnappers who killed her Iraqi interpreter.
The Christian Science Monitor identified her as the freelancer on assignment when seized.
Carroll, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, moved to Jordan before the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.
She is the 31st media worker kidnapped in Iraq since the war began.
The US government denied negotiating with insurgents, while a study estimated the war's cost at up to two trillion dollars.
Carroll's family pleaded for her release after her captors threatened her with execution.

Lawyers were set to begin crucial final arguments Tuesday in the case of two Sikh immigrants from India accused of the 1985 mid-air bombing of an Air India plane which left 329 people dead.
Closing arguments were expected to start with the defence of Ripudaman Singh Malik, a millionaire businessman in Vancouver.
Lawyers for rural mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri then were to present their defence, followed by the prosecution team.

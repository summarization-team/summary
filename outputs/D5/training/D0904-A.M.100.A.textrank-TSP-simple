But a local politician said that the multi-ethnic neighborhood was not particularly beset by violence.
The violence broke out after a group of nearly 80 white supremacists of the Virigina-based National Socialist Movement assembled for a march against what they called black gang violence against whites in the Toledo neighborhood.
Rioting erupted Saturday in an impoverished neighborhood of Toledo, Ohio after hundreds of counter-protestors broke up a planned march by a neo-Nazi group, Toledo police confirmed.
Bob White, leader of the movement, said police forced his group to disband after the protestors gathered around them and began to throw stones.

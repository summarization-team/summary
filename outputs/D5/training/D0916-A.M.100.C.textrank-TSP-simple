The incident had previously been reported from Baghdad, but Carroll had not been identified.
Carroll was abducted in western Baghdad on Saturday, by kidnappers who killed her Iraqi interpreter, the paper said in a statement, calling for her release.
The Christian Science Monitor on Monday named a US journalist kidnapped in Iraq as freelancer Jill Carroll, who was on assignment for the US-based paper when she was seized.
In recent months, the Monitor has tapped into her professionalism, energy, and fair reporting on the Iraqi scene," the Monitor statement said.

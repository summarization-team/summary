European space probe Huygens separates from US craft
The European-made space probe Huygens has successfully separated from the US spacecraft Cassini and headed toward Titan, a NASA official said on Saturday.
At launch time, specially designed springs gently pushed Huygens away from Cassini onto a ballistic four-million-kilometer (about 2.5-million-mile) path toward Titan.
It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan, the only moon in the solar system which has an atmosphere.

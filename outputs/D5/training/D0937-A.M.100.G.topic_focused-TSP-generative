Harry Whittington was admitted to the hospital after being accidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney during a quail hunting trip.
The incident, not immediately disclosed by the White House, left Whittington with injuries to his shoulder, upper body, chest, and neck.
Despite not having the required hunting permit, Cheney sent a check to cover the cost.
Whittington, a prominent lawyer, was alert and in stable condition.
The delayed disclosure of the incident sparked criticism, with Cheney's staff being blamed for the lack of transparency.
Whittington's injuries were not severe, and he was expected to recover well.

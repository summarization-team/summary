Harry Whittington was admitted to the intensive care unit after being accidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney during a quail hunting trip.
The incident occurred at the Armstrong Ranch in Texas, where Whittington was hit in the shoulder, upper body, chest, and neck.
Despite the seriousness of the accident, Whittington was reported to be in good health and doing well.
The White House faced criticism for not immediately disclosing the incident to the media, with Cheney lacking the proper hunting permit.
Whittington, a prominent lawyer, was treated at a Corpus Christi hospital and listed in stable condition.

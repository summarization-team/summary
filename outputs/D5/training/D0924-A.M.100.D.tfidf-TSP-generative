Vioxx, a lucrative arthritis drug, faced global withdrawal by Merck due to increased stroke and heart attack risks.
The European Medicines Agency reviewed COX-2 inhibitors, including Vioxx, but initially deemed them safe.
However, subsequent studies revealed alarming cardiovascular dangers, prompting legal actions against Merck.
The FDA estimated thousands of heart attacks linked to Vioxx, leading to a significant financial hit for the pharmaceutical giant.
Despite early warnings and mounting lawsuits, Vioxx remained on the market for years, raising questions about regulatory oversight and corporate responsibility.

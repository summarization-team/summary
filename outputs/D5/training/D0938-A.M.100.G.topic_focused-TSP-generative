Former US presidents, including Bush, Clinton, Carter, and Ford, have joined the board for a permanent memorial honoring the victims of the 9/11 attacks.
The memorial, set to open in 2009, will feature a forest of oak trees, reflecting pools marking the towers' footprints, and a Memorial Hall.
The board aims to raise $500 million for the project.
The centerpiece will be a surviving granite fragment from the original memorial.
Governor Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg praised the design, emphasizing the importance of remembering and remaining vigilant.
The memorial is expected to be a powerful tribute to those lost in the tragic events.

Former US presidents, including Bush, Clinton, Carter, and Ford, have joined the board for a permanent memorial honoring the victims of the 9/11 attacks.
The memorial will feature a forest of oak trees, reflecting pools marking the towers' footprints, and a Memorial Hall for gatherings.
The board aims to raise $500 million for the memorial and cultural facilities.
A surviving fragment from the old memorial has been installed as the centerpiece of the new one.
The memorial, set to open in 2009, will pay tribute to the victims of both the 2001 and 1993 attacks.

A historic conclave at the Vatican is underway to elect a new pope for a church in turmoil.
The cardinals face a crucial decision between an older, experienced administrator or a younger, charismatic pastor.
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a frontrunner, led the procession to the chapel, where they took an oath of secrecy.
The cardinals failed to reach a decision on the first ballot, signaling a longer process.
Opus Dei's potential influence and Ratzinger's strong defense of orthodoxy are key factors.
The world awaits the white smoke that will announce the new leader of 1.1 billion Roman Catholics.

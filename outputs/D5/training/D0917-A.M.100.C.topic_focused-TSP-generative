A historic conclave at the Vatican to elect a new pope is underway.
Cardinals from around the globe gathered in the Sistine Chapel, facing a choice between an older administrator or a younger pastor.
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a frontrunner, led the proceedings.
The cardinals took an oath of secrecy before casting their first ballots.
Despite hopes for a quick decision, black smoke signaled no pope had been chosen yet.
Opus Dei's influence and Ratzinger's conservative stance are key factors in the selection process.
The world awaits the decision that will shape the future of the Roman Catholic Church.

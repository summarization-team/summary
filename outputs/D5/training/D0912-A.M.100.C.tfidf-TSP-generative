Cindy Sheehan, a grieving mother, met with top White House officials near President Bush's ranch to demand answers about the Iraq war.
She clutched photos of her son, a fallen soldier, and expressed her desire for troops to come home.
She criticized the administration's justifications for the war and vowed to continue her protest until she could confront Bush directly.
Despite Bush's sympathy for her loss, he emphasized the importance of completing the mission in Iraq before withdrawing troops.
Sheehan's vigil has drawn support and media attention, sparking debate about the war's direction and impact.

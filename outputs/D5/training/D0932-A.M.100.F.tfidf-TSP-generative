Plastic bags in Kenya are causing a major environmental and health crisis, leading to a call for a ban and hefty fines by the United Nations Environment Programme.
Similar actions have been taken in Eritrea and Rwanda to combat the issue.
In San Francisco and Los Angeles, proposals to charge fees for plastic bags are being considered to reduce waste and environmental impact.
Meanwhile, Uganda and Tanzania are also taking steps to ban or reduce the use of plastic bags due to their harmful effects on the environment and public health.

This represents a big shareholder win and a major step forward in the case," Jay Eisenhofer, the plaintiffs lawyer, said in a statement.
A federal judge has allowed Tyco International Ltd. shareholders to go forward with a class action lawsuit against the company and others.
In the class-action lawsuit, shareholders seek damages against the company, Kozlowski; Swartz; Mark Belnick, former director Frank Walsh; and the company's auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Former top executives L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz are awaiting retrial in federal court in New York on charges of stealing $600 million (euro483.33 million) from the company.

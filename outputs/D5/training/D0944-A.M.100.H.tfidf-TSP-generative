The US Supreme Court recently debated the legality of executing criminals aged under 18, focusing on the case of Christopher Simmons.
Advocates argued against juvenile executions, citing evolving standards of decency and international consensus.
Justices discussed the morality of such punishments, with some highlighting the inconsistency of allowing executions while minors are barred from other activities.
The court also addressed issues related to federal sentencing guidelines and the use of drug-sniffing dogs in routine traffic stops.
Overall, the debate centered on whether executing juvenile offenders aligns with societal values and global norms.

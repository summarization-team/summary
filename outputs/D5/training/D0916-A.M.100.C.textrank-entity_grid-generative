Her Iraqi interpreter was killed during the abduction.
The Monitor called for her release, highlighting her efforts to uncover truths about the Iraq war.
Carroll's family pleaded for mercy, emphasizing her dedication to the Iraqi people.
The US government denied negotiating with insurgents but acknowledged reaching out to non-participating groups.

Her captors threatened to execute her unless female prisoners were released within 72 hours.
The situation remains tense as efforts continue to secure her freedom.

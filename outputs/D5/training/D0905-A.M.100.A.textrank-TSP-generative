Taiwan Power Co. plans to invest over NT $10 billion in wind power generation over the next decade.
They aim to set up 200 wind power generators with a total capacity of 300,000 kilowatts in coastal regions.
This initiative aligns with the government's eco-friendly policy.
However, an amendment in Congress could halt offshore wind-power projects, causing concern among environmental groups and developers.
Despite debates over aesthetics and economic viability, the push for renewable energy sources like wind power continues to grow globally, with offshore wind farms gaining traction in Europe.

Taiwan Power Co. plans to invest over NT $10 billion in wind power generation over the next decade.
They aim to set up 200 wind power generators with a total capacity of 300,000 kilowatts in coastal regions.
This initiative aligns with the government's eco-friendly policy.
However, an amendment in Congress could halt offshore wind projects, causing concern among developers.
Despite debates over aesthetics and economic viability, the Cape Wind project moves forward.
The push for renewable energy sources like wind power is gaining momentum, with companies offering environmentally friendly options at competitive prices.
The future of offshore wind energy remains promising, especially in Europe.

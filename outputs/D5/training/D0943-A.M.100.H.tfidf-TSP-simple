Lawyers were set to begin crucial final arguments Tuesday in the case of two Sikh immigrants from India accused of the 1985 mid-air bombing of an Air India plane which left 329 people dead.
Though separated by long years and thousands of miles, both the 2001 hijackings of four US jets, two of which crashed into New York's World Trade Center, and the 1985 Air India bombings, were allegedly carried out by fundamentalists bent on revenge against a foreign government.

A record of the alleged December 2003 transaction was discovered in documents seized in a search of the home of Jackson's personal assistant, the court heard.
The bombshell was dropped during a pre-trial hearing in Jackson's child molestation case when prosecutors revealed they had recently discovered documents linking Miko Brando with the alleged crime.
Count one on the 10-count criminal indictment alleges that Jackson and co-conspirators planned to abduct a child, to falsely imprison someone and to extort someone.

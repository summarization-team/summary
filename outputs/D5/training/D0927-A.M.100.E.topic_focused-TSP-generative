ABC News anchor Peter Jennings has been diagnosed with lung cancer, prompting sadness among colleagues.
Despite undergoing outpatient chemotherapy, Jennings aims to continue anchoring "World News Tonight" when possible.
The news comes amidst a generational shift in network anchors, with Jennings being one of the last iconic faces.
ABC executives emphasize Jennings remains the anchor, but plans for a successor are being considered.
In his absence, coanchors like Elizabeth Vargas and Charles Gibson will step in.
Jennings' determination to work during treatment reflects his dedication to journalism and his team.

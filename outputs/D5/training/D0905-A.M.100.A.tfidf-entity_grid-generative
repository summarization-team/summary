Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) plans to invest over NT $10 billion in wind power generation over the next decade.
The 10-year initiative aims to support the government's eco-friendly policies by installing 200 wind turbines with a total capacity of 300,000 kilowatts in coastal areas.
Meanwhile, in the US, a defense bill amendment could impact offshore wind projects, including one in Massachusetts.
Despite opposition, advocates highlight the benefits of wind energy, emphasizing its potential to combat climate change and promote cleaner electricity sources.
The global shift towards renewable energy sources, like wind power, reflects a growing commitment to sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas

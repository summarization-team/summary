American journalist Jill Carroll, working for the Christian Science Monitor, was abducted in Baghdad by gunmen who killed her Iraqi interpreter.
The Monitor and officials in Baghdad called for her release as she was on her way to interview a Sunni Arab politician.
Carroll's family and colleagues pleaded for her safe return, emphasizing her dedication to truth in her reporting on the Iraq war.
The kidnappers threatened to kill her if demands were not met.
Despite efforts by US officials and appeals for her release, Carroll's fate remained uncertain as she was held captive since January 7th.

American journalist Jill Carroll was abducted in Baghdad by gunmen who killed her Iraqi interpreter.
The Christian Science Monitor identified her as the freelancer on assignment.
She was seized on her way to interview Sunni politician Adnan al-Dulaimi.
The Monitor and Carroll's family pleaded for her safe release, highlighting her dedication to truth in her reporting.
Meanwhile, French hostage Bernard Planche escaped his captors.
Carroll's captors threatened to kill her if demands were not met.
Despite efforts by US officials and appeals for her release, no group has claimed responsibility for her abduction.

Peter Jennings, the iconic ABC News anchor, has been diagnosed with lung cancer, prompting him to undergo chemotherapy.
Despite his illness, he plans to continue anchoring "World News Tonight" when possible.
Jennings, along with Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw, represented a bygone era of network news dominance.
The departure of these anchors marks a shift in television journalism.
While Jennings battles cancer, interim anchors like Charles Gibson and Elizabeth Vargas will step in.
The future of network news hangs in the balance as audiences grapple with the changing landscape of media consumption.

Chess legend Bobby Fischer, facing prison in the US, has been detained in Japan since July for attempting to leave with an invalid passport.
Despite his engagement to the head of the Japan Chess Association, media coverage has been minimal.
To avoid deportation, Iceland must grant him full citizenship, as his US nationality complicates his legal status.
Icelandic lawmakers are considering granting Fischer citizenship, with widespread support in Iceland.
Fischer's supporters are optimistic about his potential release from Japanese custody if he obtains Icelandic citizenship, allowing him to make Iceland his new home.

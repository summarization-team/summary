Chess legend Bobby Fischer, detained in Japan for attempting to leave with an invalid US passport, faces deportation to the US.
To avoid this fate, Iceland must upgrade his residency to full citizenship.
Despite Iceland's initial rejection, recent developments suggest a change in granting Fischer citizenship.
Supporters anticipate his release from Japanese custody once he obtains Icelandic citizenship.
Fischer's case, marked by political motivations and legal complexities, highlights the contrasting views of him as a fugitive in the US and a national hero in Iceland.
His future residence in Iceland seems imminent, pending final decisions and confirmations.

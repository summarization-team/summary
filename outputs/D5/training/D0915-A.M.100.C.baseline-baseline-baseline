At least 30 people were killed in Iraq as insurgents intensified attacks on Iraqi and US targets, and election workers backed by troops started distributing ballot boxes for the vote in just two days "'" time.
The latest attacks Thursday came as Iraqi exiles voting in Australia and New Zealand became the first to vote in their country's historic national elections early Friday.
The exiles began casting votes as a British newspaper reported the United States and Britain have privately agreed on a way of withdrawing their troops from Iraq.

Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, has made a surprise comeback with a new single featuring Ronan Keating.
The singer, who converted to Islam 30 years ago, is also working on a Broadway musical and recently performed at a charity concert in London.
However, he faced deportation from the US due to a spelling mixup on his passport.
Despite this, he remains dedicated to promoting peace and condemning terrorism.
Additionally, the band Chevelle, influenced by artists like Yusuf Islam, has found success with their music that delves into societal issues.

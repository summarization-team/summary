Wong said U.S.-based Walt Disney Co. decided to observe feng shui because it wanted to defer to local custom.
Disney officials consulted Chinese feng shui experts before building Hong Kong Disneyland, making changes such as tilting the site of the park several degrees and setting up "no fire zones" in kitchens, a company spokeswoman said Sunday.
Other feng shui influences include the park's orientation to face water with mountains behind, Hong Kong Disneyland spokeswoman Esther Wong said.
The park's groundbreaking date and opening date of Sept. 12 were picked after conferring with feng shui specialists, she said.

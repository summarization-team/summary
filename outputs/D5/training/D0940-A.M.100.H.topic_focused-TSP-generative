Hong Kong Disneyland, built with feng shui principles in mind, aims to attract millions of visitors, mainly from mainland China.
Despite concerns about overcrowding, the park maintains its maximum capacity.
The government hopes the park will boost tourism, but critics question its impact.
With hotels of varying prices nearby, the park offers familiar Disney attractions.
As the grand opening approaches, ticket sales are going well, with special arrangements for guests and banking services.
The park's opening is expected to transform Hong Kong tourism, especially for families and mainland Chinese visitors.

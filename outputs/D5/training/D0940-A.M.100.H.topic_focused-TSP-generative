Hong Kong Disneyland, built with feng shui principles, aims to attract millions of tourists, mainly from mainland China.
Despite concerns about economic impact, the park offers a mix of classic Disney attractions and two unique hotels.
While some criticize its overrated status, others see it as a positive addition to Hong Kong's tourism landscape.
With plans for smooth operations, including online ticket sales and transportation services, the park is gearing up for its grand opening on September 12.
Anticipation is high as Hong Kong prepares to welcome visitors to this magical destination.

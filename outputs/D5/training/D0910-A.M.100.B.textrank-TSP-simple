Swiss officials met the chief negotiator of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Anton Balasingham and other rebel officials on the sidelines of the meeting of the LTTE's Consitutional Affairs Committee in Geneva, which is due to end on October 7.
The Tamil Tigers were reportedly undertaking a three-week tour of Denmark, Ireland, Switzerland and Sri Lanka's peace broker Norway to persuade donors to use aid as a tool to pressure the government to resume peace talks based on rebel self-rule proposals.

Peter Jennings revealed that he is suffering from lung cancer and plans to continue on "World News Tonight" as much as possible after beginning chemotherapy next week.
Jennings, ABC's chief anchorman since 1983, was replaced by Elizabeth Vargas on Tuesday but taped a message telling viewers about his diagnosis.
I will continue to do the broadcast," he said.
On good days, my voice will not always be like this.
Certainly, it's been a long time.

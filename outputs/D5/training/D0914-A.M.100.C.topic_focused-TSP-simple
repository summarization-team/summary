Israeli intelligence services have been warning Israeli holidaymakers to keep out of the Sinai desert, where Taba is located.
Shortly after the hotel blast, a second explosion was heard in the Sinai desert region of Nuaiba, between the Red Sea resorts of Taba and Sharm el-Sheikh, an Egyptian police source said.
The blast, the reasons for which were not immediately clear, killed or wounded at least 100 people of different nationalities, an Egyptian hospital source said.

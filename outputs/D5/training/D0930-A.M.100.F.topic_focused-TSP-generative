Environmentalists advocate slashing emissions and transitioning to renewable sources and hydrogen to combat global warming.
While capturing CO2 from fuel is a step towards being "carbon neutral," it's not a complete solution.
The urgency stems from the limited time to address carbon pollution from fossil fuels.
Efforts include studying carbon capture and storage, cutting emissions by 60% by 2050, and exploring emerging technologies.
The challenge lies in balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability, especially in regulating greenhouse gas emissions.
The focus is on developing strategies like carbon sequestration to mitigate the impact of rising carbon dioxide levels.

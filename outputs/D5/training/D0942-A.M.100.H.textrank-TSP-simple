China Tuesday said that "one country, two systems" is its basic approach to Taiwan as it outlined for the first time its anti-secession law aimed at the island.
The government will also continue to express its opposition to the proposed anti-secession law, which, if passed, would offer a legal basis for Beijing to use force against Taiwan, Lu went on.
The mainland's plan to promulgate an anti-secession law is not only a tremendous provocation of Taiwan but also a unilateral move to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Chiu told reporters.

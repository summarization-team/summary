Apple Computer is set to announce a major shift to Intel chips in its Macintosh machines, ending a long-standing partnership with IBM.
This move is seen as a response to competition from Microsoft and Sony in the home entertainment market.
Intel stands to benefit from this high-profile win, while IBM focuses on other ventures like making processors for game consoles.
Apple's CEO, Steve Jobs, expressed excitement about the transition, citing Intel's strong processor roadmap.
The switch is expected to allow Apple to lower prices and enhance performance, positioning them for future success in the computer market.

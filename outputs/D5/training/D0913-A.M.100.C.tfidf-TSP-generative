The US Supreme Court recently reviewed cases involving the public display of the Ten Commandments, sparking debates on the separation of church and state.
Justices grappled with the context of religious exhibits in Texas and Kentucky, questioning the constitutionality of government-endorsed religious messages.
Arguments centered on the historical significance versus religious implications of the displays.
Opponents argued that the displays violated the First Amendment by promoting Christianity.
The court's decision could redefine the boundaries between religion and government in American society.
Amidst protests and legal battles, the outcome remains uncertain, with implications for future church-state relations.

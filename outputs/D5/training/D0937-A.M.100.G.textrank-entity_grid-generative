A hunting accident involving US Vice President Dick Cheney left prominent Texas lawyer Harry Whittington injured but in stable condition.
Cheney accidentally shot Whittington while targeting quail on a Texas ranch, hitting him in the face, neck, and chest.
The incident was not immediately disclosed, leading to criticism of the delayed notification.
Whittington received medical care and was reported to be recovering well, cracking jokes despite the publicity.
Cheney visited him in the hospital and expressed apologies for the accident.
The White House faced scrutiny over the handling of the incident, with questions raised about transparency and timing of the disclosure.

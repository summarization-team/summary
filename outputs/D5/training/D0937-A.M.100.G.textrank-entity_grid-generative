The man accidentally shot by US Vice President Dick Cheney while hunting in Texas is in stable condition at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial.
Cheney turned to shoot quail, hitting Harry Whittington with shotgun pellets in the shoulder, chest, and neck.
The delay in reporting was attributed to focusing on Whittington's medical care.
Cheney visited Whittington in the hospital and expressed remorse for the incident.
The White House faced criticism for the delayed notification.
Whittington, a prominent lawyer, was treated for injuries to his face, neck, and chest, but was reported to be alert and in good spirits.

Chess legend Bobby Fischer, facing prison in the US, seeks Icelandic citizenship to avoid deportation from Japan.
Japanese officials plan to deport him unless Iceland grants him nationality.
Despite Iceland offering residency, Fischer's US citizenship complicates his case.
Recently, Iceland granted him citizenship, potentially allowing him to evade US prosecution for violating sanctions.
Fischer, known for his unpredictability, may soon leave Japan for Iceland.
Icelandic parliament's decision to grant him citizenship paves the way for his release from detention.
Supporters anticipate Fischer making Iceland his new home, ending his legal limbo and allowing him to travel freely.

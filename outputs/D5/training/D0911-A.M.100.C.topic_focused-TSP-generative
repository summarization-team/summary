Chess legend Bobby Fischer, facing prison in the US, seeks Icelandic citizenship to avoid deportation from Japan.
Japanese officials plan to deport him unless Iceland grants nationality.
Despite being held for using an invalid US passport, Fischer's renunciation of US citizenship remains unresolved.
Iceland's recent grant of residency, not full citizenship, failed to prevent deportation.
However, Icelandic parliament is now likely to offer Fischer citizenship, allowing him to leave Japan.
Supporters anticipate his release and relocation to Iceland, marking a new chapter in Fischer's tumultuous saga.

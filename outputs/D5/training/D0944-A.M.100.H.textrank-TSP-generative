The US Supreme Court debated the legality of the death penalty for criminals under 18, with international attention on the Simmons case.
Arguments focused on whether juvenile offenders should face execution, considering their maturity and the global consensus against such penalties.
Justices grappled with the implications of abolishing the death penalty for minors, similar to the ban on executing the mentally retarded in 2002.
The court's decision could impact thousands of cases and potentially lead to a reevaluation of federal sentencing guidelines, raising concerns about fairness and constitutional rights in the criminal justice system.

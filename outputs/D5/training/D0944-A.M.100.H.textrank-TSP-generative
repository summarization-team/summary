The US Supreme Court debated the legality of executing criminals under 18, with international attention on the Simmons case.
Arguments focused on whether juvenile offenders understand consequences and if executions deter crime.
Justices considered a national consensus against juvenile death penalties, similar to the ban on executing the mentally retarded.
Seth Waxman argued for limiting capital punishment to legal adults, while Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon advocated for maintaining the ability to execute minors.
The court's decision could impact thousands of cases and potentially redefine the federal sentencing system, raising concerns about fairness and constitutional rights.

A Justice Department lawyer wrote a secret memo to the White House in 2001 concluding that President George W. Bush has the authority to wage preemptive war against terrorists and countries even if they were not linked to the September 11 attacks, Newsweek magazine reported Saturday.
According to the memo there are effectively "no limits" on the presidents authority to wage war, Newsweek reports, noting that it seems to lay the legal groundwork for Bush to invade Iraq even without approval Congressional approval.

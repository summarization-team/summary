Hong Kong Disneyland faced backlash for planning to serve shark fin soup, but dropped the dish due to environmentalist protests.
The park, a joint venture between Disney and the Hong Kong government, aims to attract tourists and boost the economy.
Concerns about low-spending visitors from China creating more problems than benefits have been raised.
Despite some criticism, the park offers a mix of classic Disney attractions and unique experiences.
With preparations underway for the grand opening, Hong Kong Disneyland is set to become a major tourist destination, drawing visitors from mainland China and beyond.

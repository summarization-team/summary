Hong Kong Disneyland faced backlash for planning to serve shark fin soup, but dropped the dish due to environmentalist protests.
The park, a joint venture between Disney and the Hong Kong government, aims to attract 5.6 million visitors in its first year.
Concerns have been raised about low-spending tourists from China creating more problems than benefits.
Despite some criticism, the park has sold out all 16,000 tickets for its opening day.
To accommodate visitors, special transport services and communication channels have been set up.
The park's grand opening is set for September 12, with rehearsals underway to ensure a smooth start.

By August that year, shoppers had already cut the use of plastic bags by 90 percent, the environment ministry announced.
Discarded plastic bags "provide several million habitats for mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria," she said, noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant mortality in Kenya and throughout Africa.
The state-run Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA) and National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) said at least two million plastic bags a year were being distributed to shoppers in Nairobi alone, many of which were not disposed of properly.

Maathai, who serves as Kenya's deputy environment minister, pledged to push the Kenyan government to adopt measures to reduce the use of plastic bags.
By August that year, shoppers had already cut the use of plastic bags by 90 percent, the environment ministry announced.
The government announced that the funds raised from a tax on plastic bags would be used for an office for environment enforcement, implementing a national waste prevention programme and the disposal of fridges and freezers.

The US Supreme Court recently debated the legality of the death penalty for criminals under 18, focusing on the case of Christopher Simmons.
Advocates argue that executing juvenile offenders is akin to putting the mentally challenged to death, a practice banned in 2002.
Justices grappled with the moral implications of executing young murderers, considering a potential shift in national consensus against such penalties.
The court also addressed the issue of federal sentencing guidelines following the Blakely ruling.
Overall, the debate revolves around whether executing juvenile criminals aligns with evolving societal values and international norms.

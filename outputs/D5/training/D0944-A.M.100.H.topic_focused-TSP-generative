The US Supreme Court recently debated the legality of the death penalty for criminals under 18, focusing on Christopher Simmons' case.
Advocates argue against juvenile executions, likening it to the ban on executing the mentally challenged.
Justices grappled with the morality of executing young murderers, questioning if a national consensus exists against it.
The court also considered a case on marijuana use for medicinal purposes, challenging Congress's authority to regulate intrastate drug trade.
With global attention on the issue, the court's decision on juvenile death penalties remains pivotal, especially as the US stands out for still permitting such executions.

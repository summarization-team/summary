Prince Charles, previously married to Princess Diana, will wed Camilla Parker Bowles in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle.
The Archbishop of Canterbury will preside over a service at St. George's Chapel.
Despite past controversies, the couple's engagement has received support from the public and Queen Elizabeth.
While some compare Camilla to Diana, others believe she will never reach the same level of popularity.
The prince's sons, William and Harry, are pleased with the news.
Camilla will become the HRH Duchess of Cornwall, but not the Princess of Wales.
The marriage signifies a significant shift in royal traditions.

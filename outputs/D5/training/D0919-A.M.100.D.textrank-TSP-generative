Prince Charles will marry Camilla Parker Bowles in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle on April 8.
The Archbishop of Canterbury supports their decision, emphasizing Church of England guidelines.
The couple's engagement was met with congratulations from Prime Minister Tony Blair and the public.
Despite comparisons to Princess Diana, Camilla will become HRH Duchess of Cornwall, not Queen.
The marriage has little political impact but has captured national attention.
Charles' sons, William and Harry, are pleased with the news.
Queen Elizabeth has given her blessing, marking a significant shift in royal acceptance of the union.

Prominent Texas lawyer Harry Whittington, accidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney while hunting, is in stable condition at a Corpus Christi hospital.
The incident, where Cheney mistook Whittington for a quail, made headlines for the delayed disclosure by Cheney's office.
Whittington, a millionaire attorney, suffered pellet wounds to his face, neck, and chest.
Cheney, known for his hunting trips, will receive a warning citation for a hunting stamp violation.
The incident raised questions about transparency in the White House and sparked late-night talk show discussions.
Whittington's recovery progress is closely monitored, with Cheney's actions under scrutiny.

The man accidentally shot by US Vice President Dick Cheney while hunting in Texas is in stable condition at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi.
The prominent Texas lawyer, Harry Whittington, suffered injuries to his shoulder, upper body, chest, and neck.
Cheney's spokeswoman confirmed the incident, stating that Cheney mistook Whittington for a quail.
The delay in reporting was attributed to focusing on Whittington's medical care.
Whittington, 78, is recovering well and was visited by Cheney at the hospital.
The incident raised concerns about transparency and safety during hunting trips.

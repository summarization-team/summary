The REAL ID Act, not a national ID card, sets standards for state driver's licenses to enhance security.

Proponents argue it will enhance national security by preventing terrorists from exploiting loopholes.
However, opponents view it as an anti-immigrant measure that could lead to a de facto national ID system.
The debate continues as lawmakers grapple with balancing security concerns and civil liberties in immigration policy.

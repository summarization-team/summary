We have to pay more attention to young women, this is where the greatest potential risks exist," the president of the association, Daniel Pereira da Silva, told the newspaper.
The study was carried out by the association among 3,858 women between the ages of 15 and 49, the paper said.
The study, one of the largest ever carried out into the contraceptive habits of Portuguese women, also found 16 percent of all sexually active girls in this age group do not use any form of birth control at all, the paper said.

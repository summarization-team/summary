Kenya's deputy environment minister, Maathai, spearheaded efforts to reduce plastic bag usage, resulting in a 90% decrease by August.
The United Nations Environment Programme supported banning plastic bags and imposing levies on thicker ones to combat environmental and health risks.
The government allocated funds from a plastic bag tax for environmental enforcement and waste prevention.
Similar initiatives in other countries aim to reduce plastic waste.
Meanwhile, Rwanda and Uganda are also taking steps to ban plastic bags due to environmental concerns.
Tanzania is establishing a recycling plant to address the growing issue of plastic waste.

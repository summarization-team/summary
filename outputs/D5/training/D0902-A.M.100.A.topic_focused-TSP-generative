A study in Portugal revealed that 83.4% of teenage girls received contraceptive information at school.
However, 16% of sexually active girls aged 15-19 do not use any form of birth control.
Nearly one-third of these girls have taken the morning-after pill to prevent pregnancy.
The pill, containing levonorgestrel, inhibits ovulation.
Despite controversy, experts clarify that it does not induce abortion.
Access to emergency contraception, like Plan B, can reduce unwanted pregnancies without increasing risky behavior.
The debate over making it available over the counter continues, with concerns about moral objections and potential impact on abortion rates.

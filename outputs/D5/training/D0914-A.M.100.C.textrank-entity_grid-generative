A devastating car bomb attack at the Hilton hotel in Taba, near the Israel-Egypt border, killed or wounded over 100 people, including at least 23 Israelis.
Additional explosions in tourist camps in the Sinai Peninsula resulted in more casualties.
Israeli officials suspected Hamas involvement, coinciding with Jewish holidays.
Despite warnings, many Israelis continued to visit Sinai, with over 300,000 tourists during the summer.
The explosions prompted Israeli evacuation efforts, with concerns of further attacks.
The situation highlighted tensions in the region, with conflicting reports on the causes of the blasts and the ongoing Gaza conflict.

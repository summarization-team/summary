The Christian Science Monitor on Monday named a US journalist kidnapped in Iraq as freelancer Jill Carroll, who was on assignment for the US-based paper when she was seized.
Carroll was abducted in western Baghdad on Saturday, by kidnappers who killed her Iraqi interpreter, the paper said in a statement, calling for her release.
The incident had previously been reported from Baghdad, but Carroll had not been identified.
Carroll is the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders (Reporters sans Frontieres, or RSF).

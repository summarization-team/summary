LITTLETON, Colo. (AP)--The sheriff's initial estimate of as many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building counted some victims more than once.
The discrepancy occurred because the SWAT teams that picked their way past bombs and bodies in an effort to secure building covered overlapping areas, said sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis.
As they gave periodic updates through the night, Davis and Stone emphasized the death toll was unconfirmed.

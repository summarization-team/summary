Shouting "murderers," and "You deserve lynching," the crowd demanded to know whether their relatives were actually on board the Helios Airways flight ZU522 that left Larnaca for Athens International Airport when it crashed at about 12:20 p.m. (0920GMT) near Grammatiko, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Greek capital.
Cyprus "'" radio and television stations cancelled their daily programs to relay uninterrupted coverage on the crash as people telephoned to seek news or speculate over what might have caused the crash.

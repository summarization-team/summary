In London, The Guardian newspaper reported US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his British counterpart Geoff Hoon have agreed on a so-called exit-strategy based on doubling the number of Iraqi police trainees and setting up Iraqi paramilitary units.
In one deadly attack Thursday, a car driven by a suicide bomber rammed an Iraqi army patrol in Samarra, a mainly Sunni Arab city north of Baghdad where US and Iraqi forces launched a massive operation last October to wrest control from insurgents before the vote.

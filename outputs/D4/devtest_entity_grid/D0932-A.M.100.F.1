The state-run Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA) and National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) said at least two million plastic bags a year were being distributed to shoppers in Nairobi alone, many of which were not disposed of properly.
The call came in a study of Kenya's solid waste management presented to UNEP governors who are currently meeting at the agency's headquarters here and was backed by Wangari Maathai, last year's Nobel Peace Prize.

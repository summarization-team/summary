A Justice Department lawyer wrote a secret memo to the White House in 2001 concluding that President George W. Bush has the authority to wage preemptive war against terrorists and countries even if they were not linked to the September 11 attacks, Newsweek magazine reported Saturday.
There was a general awareness after Sept. 11 that the enemy was not simply Al-Qaeda--but militant Islam in general," Brad Berenson, who served in the White House counsels office at the time, told Newsweek.

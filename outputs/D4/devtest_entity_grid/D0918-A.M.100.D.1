The movement that Friedan's energy sparked continues to grow, and is bigger today than she could ever have dreamed when she helped launch it in the 1960s," Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation and a former president of the National Organization for Women, said in a statement.
Friedan achieved prominence in l963 with the publication of her book "The Feminine Mystique," which detailed the lives of American women who were expected to find fulfillment through the achievements of their husbands and children.

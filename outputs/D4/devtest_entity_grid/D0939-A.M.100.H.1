After hitting the car, the packed rush-hour train, which was bound for Los Angeles "'" Union Station, jumped its tracks and jack-knifed into the path of an oncoming commuter train heading in the opposite direction.
Ten people were killed and more than 100 injured Wednesday when two commuter trains slammed into each other after one of them hit a car left on the lines by a suicidal man, police said.

Two of the suspects, identified as Surinamese brothers Satish and Deepak Kaploe, told police Natalee had been drinking and fell down as she got of the car in front of the hotel, the source told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
The men were arrested Thursday in connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, who they said they last saw in front of the Holiday Inn shortly before 2 a.m. on May 30.

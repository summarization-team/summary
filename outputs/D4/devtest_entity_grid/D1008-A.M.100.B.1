The Becks were among two dozen watermen, some scuba-diving and some using hand tongs, who set out to get their share of the disease-free oysters from three managed reserves, known as Emory Hollow and Blunts Bar in the Chester River and Bolingbroke Sands in the Choptank River.
Last weekend, three generations of the Beck family--Bill, son Craig and father John, 76--boarded their boat with renewed optimism as nearly 4,000 bushels of disease-free oysters were made available for harvesting for the first time since they were hatched and planted three years ago.

The clash erupted when a convoy of soldiers came under attack by armed men belonging to the Bugti tribe in the clan's stronghold of Dera Bugti, some 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of the provincial capital Quetta, he said.
Gunbattles between the renegade clansmen and troops from Pakistan's Frontier Corps continued throughout the day after the attack in Baluchistan province, corps chief Major General Shujjat Zamir Dar told reporters.
Earlier corps spokesman Colonel Rizwan Malik said the tribesmen used light and heavy weapons and also rained more than 150 rockets and mortar shells on a nearby military base.

After taking into account the patients "'" socioeconomic background, family history of psychosis, early parental death and other factors that could affect the outcome, the researchers found a strong statistical link between schizophrenics and the age of their father.
The authors say this statistical evidence adds to previous research that points to an inherited source for schizophrenia and that mutations in sperm, which accumulate as a man gets older, contribute to the risk.

Chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces prison if he returns to the United States, can only avoid deportation from Japan if Iceland upgrades its granting of residency to full citizenship, a Japanese lawmaker said Wednesday.
The supporters say Fischer would not receive a fair trial in the United States due to his controversial past statements, such as hailing the September 11, 2001 attacks as "wonderful news" and anti-Jewish remarks.

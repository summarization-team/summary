The report, based on statistics provided by the Chinese government, estimated that some 250,000 people died on Chinese roads in 2002, while more than 16 million a year are injured.
Road traffic fatalities in China are predicted to increase to almost half a million deaths each year by 2020 unless urgent action is taken, the WHO said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the economic impact of China "'s" poor road safety is enormous, costing the country between 12 to 21 billion dollars annually, or between one and two percent of China "'s" GNP.

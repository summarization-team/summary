Norway is the third crude exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia and produces nearly three million barrels per day.
More than 160 of 216 people working on a Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea were evacuated Sunday after one of the rigs became "unstable "" ", causing a loss of output of 130,000 barrels per day, a company spokesman and rescue services said.
Three helicopters and four ships were helping evacuate the rest of the staff, Norwegian news agency NTB said.

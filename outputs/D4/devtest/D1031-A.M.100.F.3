The Andamanese, on the verge of extinction, were decimated by disease from colonisers in the mid-19th century and remain settled on tiny Strait Island.
Groups of rare aboriginal tribes already near the edge of extinction in the Andaman and Nicobar islands survived a massive tsunami, the coast guard said Thursday.
The origins of the endangered Andaman tribes, today only about 12 percent of the overall population of some 350,000, still mystify anthropologists.

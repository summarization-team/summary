Japan has screened every cow slaughtered for consumption after confirming mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in its own herd in September 2001.
Japan had insisted on testing all US beef imports as a condition for lifting the ban, which the US side has refused, but the difficulty in detecting the disease in younger cows led Japan to back down.
Japan, the largest export market for US beef, is among about three dozen countries that halted US beef imports after mad cow disease was discovered there in December 2003.

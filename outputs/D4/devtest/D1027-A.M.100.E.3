McKinney "'s" trial is set for Aug. 9.
(AP)--The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
McKinney "'s" trial is set for Aug. 9.
Henderson "'s" trial was originally set for March 22.
Opening arguments in Russell Henderson "'s" trial have been scheduled for April 6, according to Judge Jeffrey Donnell.
Authorities said Henderson and McKinney posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar, kidnapped him, pistol-whipped him and stole $20.

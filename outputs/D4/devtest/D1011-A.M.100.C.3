Katja and Claudia consider that they have recovered and began helping others like them last month by opening the first restaurant in Germany, and perhaps in all of Europe, where anorexics and bulimics can eat without feeling ashamed.

So that they do "n't" feel stigmatised, nothing out front or in the entryway suggests that people are entering a restaurant that caters for those with special needs.

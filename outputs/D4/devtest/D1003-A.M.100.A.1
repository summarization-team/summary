A blood bank can also simplify the process of breeding pandas because data on the pandas "'" blood types and DNA information will be readily available to bring more diversity to the gene pool.
Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources said.
There are only about 1,590 of the endangered species living in the wild, all in China, though the numbers have risen steadily in the past decade after plunging to around 1,100 in the 1980s.

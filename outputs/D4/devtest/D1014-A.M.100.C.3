Survey Shows One in Every Ten Shanghainese Overweight
SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua)--One out of every ten people in Shanghai is overweight, mostly because of improved lifestyles and poor eating habits.
Many of them gained unwanted pounds because they do not engage in regular exercise, sleep too much and eat food that is high in fat and calories, another survey of Beijing "'s" overweight people showed.
But instead figures since then have risen to 16 percent of women and 13 percent of men.

THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP)--Hurricane Floyd on Saturday whirred away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands, but forecasters warned that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be hit by heavy rains and flooding.
Five Caribbean islands canceled tropical storm watches Friday night as Floyd, packing winds of 110 mph, moved further out to sea, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
They are shopping mostly for dry foods and batteries, which are essential during a hurricane," said Lee Brooks, manager of a supermarket in The Valley, capital of the British island.
